To the frequentist this is a simple problem in which there are two closed doors with a desirable prize behind one of them.  Therefore there's a 50-50 chance of picking \"right\".\n",

Bayesian statistics takes this bit of (prior) knowledge and enables the viewer to include it into calculating probabalities of a desired outcome."
