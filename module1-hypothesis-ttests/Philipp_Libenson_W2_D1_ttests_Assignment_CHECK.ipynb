        "Mosquito nets have traditionally been an important tool to prevent mosquito bites in parts of the world where malaria is endemic. However, it may not be practical for an army that is on the move to set up and carry mosquito nets each night and day. Impregnating soldiersâ€™ uniforms with insect repellant solves the mobility problem but also has drawbacks. First, the insect repellant quickly becomes ineffective with repeated washing and ironing and must be frequently reapplied. Second, in hot and humid climates the insect repellant can be absorbed through the skin, and the long-term effects of this exposure are unknown. One compromise is to have soldiers apply patches treated with insect repellant to their clothing. These patches would last longer because they would not be washed or ironed and would not expose the entire body to the insect repellant.\n",
