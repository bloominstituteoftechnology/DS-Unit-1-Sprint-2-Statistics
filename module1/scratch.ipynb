    "Your assignment is to determine which issues have \"statistically significant\" differences between political parties in this [1980s congressional voting data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records). The data consists of 435 instances (one for each congressperson), a class (democrat or republican), and 16 binary attributes (yes or no for voting for or against certain issues). Be aware - there are missing values!\n",

    "Your goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and clean the data (or determine the best method to drop observations when running tests)\n",
    "2. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue that democrats support more than republicans with p < 0.01\n",
    "3. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue that republicans support more than democrats with p < 0.01\n",
    "4. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue where the difference between republicans and democrats has p > 0.1 (i.e. there may not be much of a difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this data will involve *2 sample* t-tests, because you're comparing averages across two groups (republicans and democrats) rather than a single group against a null hypothesis."
