But was he correct? History tells that his thermometer was a foot long and took 20 minutes to determine a subject’s temperature. For a measure that is used so often to determine general health, it would be a good idea to use modern instruments to confirm or refute his results.\n",

The mean body temperature was computed for each individual, and this summary measure is recorded in the Bodytemp.csv dataset. "
