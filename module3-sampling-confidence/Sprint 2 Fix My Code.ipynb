However, this exciting (if gory) subgenre of horror film is criticized by those who view the violence as being used to “punish” female characters who engage in sexual activity during the film. \n","\n","To test this claim, study authors randomly sampled 50 North American slasher films released from 1960 to 2009 and coded the 485 characters appearing in them as being male or female, involved in sexual activity or not, and if they survived the film or not. \n","\n","The data appears in the Slasher.csv dataset. In this project, we are going to answer a slightly simpler question: Are female characters in slasher films more likely to be \"murdered\" than male characters?\n","\n","Source: A.
