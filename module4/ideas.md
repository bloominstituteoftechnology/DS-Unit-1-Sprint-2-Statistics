# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

* Sustaining Kids and Family
* Personal Liberty & Confounding Societal Forces
* Intersection of Technology & Business


What do you know about?

* Digital Products
* Startup Business Practices
* Life "stuff"


What decisions do you face?

## Topic

**Importance of Meat and Animal Protein to Human Diet and Health**

* How does a high protein, high animal fat diet drive healty weight loss?
* How does a high protein, high animal improve outcomes with respect to "modern" chronic disease (Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc.)

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

* Different diets affect health outcomes across countries and regions globally


2. Trend related to the news

* Plant based protein food companies have made big splashes in the financial markets; are their products that much better than plain, ole meat?


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about

* Western countries are suffering from a malady that would have been unknown for most of human history: obesity and chronic diesease that would have been rare in ancient times.  Why?


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings

* Chronic disease is costly emotionally, physically, and financially. Managing it is bankrupting governments


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

* High protein/animal fat leads to negative health outcomes relative to the Standard American Diet (SAD) and plant based diets (vegetarianism, veganism)
* Consuming high protein diets is "bad" for society because of the environmental impact of growing and cultivating meat


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

* Data backed assertions that clearly support traditional thinking or refute it. That is:
    * Here's something from tradition that is being cast aside wrongly and should not be
    * Here's something breaks with tradition and is right (by the data) or clearly worthy of consideration


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

* Topic: Insulin Resistance drive chronic cognitive decline
    * Hyperinsulinemia is a driver of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

* NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
