Below is just a first draft for a couple of ideas. In the coming I will work on more/better ideas. 

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about? 
* Climate change -> renewable energy. Governmental subsidies have a big effect on adaptation rate of renewable energy, e.g. the price, production and adaptation rate of PV panels.
What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
* Adaptation rate of PV panels per (European) country.

2. Trend related to the news
* Governmental stance towards renewable energy is under constant change

3. Who does that?
* On what basis can we differentiate (new) PV users

4. Answering a question people care about
* What effect do subsidies have on PV adaptation rate

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
