Write out a paragraph describing your priorities in a company and what type of environment would be the best fit for you (small, mid, large, casual vs more formal, more or less fast-paced, etc.). If you aren’t 100% sure what this looks like, that’s ok! The point is to start thinking about what qualities you may want in a job later on.



## Response

I'd like to work at a medium-to-large sized company. My reasoning is largely driven by the mentorship opportunities and clearer paths for growth in larger companies. Likewise, I prefer a less fast-paced work environment where I could more effectively specialize. While I plan on developing full-stack data science skills (see table, above), my primary emphasis is machine learning. I'm a casual person, so hope to gain employment at a relatively casual workplace.
