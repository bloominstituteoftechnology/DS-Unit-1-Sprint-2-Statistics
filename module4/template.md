## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Yes, the sales can be different in different areas

2. Trend related to the news
No

3. Who does that?
Maybe. I could make customer profiles based on purchases if I had data by customers

4. Answering a question people care about
No

5. Valuable to businesses
Yes, stores can be interested in such a project

6. What's the most popular?
Maybe, if I want to see what products are the most populars by department

7. Cost/Money rankings
Maybe, if I want to see which products are more profitable

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Some people think an accurate forecasting will tell exactly what will be the sales, but in real world we have a lot more factors than we can use in a project. Opinions change, people change, and even an unpredicted natural catastrophe can "destroy" our prediction
