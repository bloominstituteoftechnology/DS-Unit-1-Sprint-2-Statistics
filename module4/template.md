## You

What do you care about?
- a corelation between prior education and earnings(salary)

What do you know about?
- There are bias that computer science major background earn more than other majors or non-college education

What decisions do you face?

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about

2. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- like i said in the very beginning, people normally think computer science degree background software engineers are superior in their fieild, specifically earnings.

- The training kit told us not to use kaggle, but I can't find this dataset other than from kaggle
- so i stick to the kaggle data (specifically stackoverflow survey data)
