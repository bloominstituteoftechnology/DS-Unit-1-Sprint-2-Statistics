# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

Rock climbing

What do you know about?

Rock climbing

What decisions do you face?

Choosing a training regiment related to climbing (how to spend time most efficiently in the gym in order to improve)

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Proximity to "real rock"/outdoor climbing vs how many people consider "climbing" a hobby

2. Trend related to the news

Major well-known rock climbing events (Free Solo winning best documentary at the Oscars, first ascent of the Dawn Wall, 
climbing being introduced as a sport at Tokyo 2020 Olympics) and how much they affect interest in climbing (possibly measured
by memberships/day passes sold at rock climbing gyms?)

3. Who does that?

Climbing is an inherently privileged hobby, so I would venture to say that climbers typically come from middle to upper class
socioeconomic backgrounds.

4. Answering a question people care about

Is there a correlation between climbing and having sustainable practices (veganism, leave no trace, preserving environment, etc)?

5. Valuable to businesses

Finding the answer to "Who does that?" could lead businesses to market more heavily towards their target demographic or search for
untapped potential client base.

6. What's the most popular?

Most popular...
-Climbing shoe?
-Chalk?
-Rope?
-Quick draws?
-Trad gear?

7. Cost/Money rankings

Most expensive brand? 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That everyone who rock climbs does exactly what Alex Honnold did in Free Solo.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I found the following article particularly interesting:

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-it-only-took-one-player-with-coronavirus-to-shutter-sports/

It helped give me another example to help explain to others that may not be taking coronavirus the importance
of shutting major sports leagues down in order to flatten the curve.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

There wasn't really a question in this article, just a visual representation of the teams that the Utah Jazz
came in contact with, as well as the teams that played the teams that played the Jazz.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

No question posed.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Possibly a visual representation on a more minute scale, replacing the Utah Jazz with Tom Hanks.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I think an interesting question could be the maximum grade someone has climbed in their respective discipline
versus identifying characteristics of that climber (gender, age, climbing age, training age, height, weight, 
wingspan, ape index, BMI), and looking to see what the strongest predictor for being a strong climber would be.

Also, maybe major climbing events vs interest in climbing, but data on this would be very difficult to collect 
as it is so subjective.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

Music

What do you know about?

Rudimentary music theory, guitar

What decisions do you face?

What songs I want to play that day?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Instrument played vs geography? Maybe more orchestral instruments near places like Carnegie Hall?

2. Trend related to the news

?

3. Who does that?

Instrument played vs demographic information

4. Answering a question people care about

-What makes a song catchy? Familiar melodies?

5. Valuable to businesses

Answering any of the above questions could generate more effective ways to market.

6. What's the most popular?

Most popular brand?

7. Cost/Money rankings

Most expensive brand?

^^Maybe restrict to guitar for above questions^^

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That guitar players only know how to play Wonderwall.

But seriously, that length of time playing leads to proficiency maybe?

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Kaggle

Other ideas that I think may work better as my project:

-NFL Combine Results vs Draft Position: What is the best predictor?
-Vegas spread vs Actual result: How closely was the spread predicted? What factors best predicted spread?
-Trump capital letters in tweet (while stock market is open) vs Dow Jones
-Trump capital letters in tweet (while stock market is closed) vs Dow Jones open next day
-Trump exclamation points/question marks in tweet (while stock market is open) vs Dow Jones
-Trump exclamation points/question marks in tweet (while stock market is closed) vs Dow Jones open next day

I feel like these datasets would be much easier to find on Kaggle or some other resource online, and they are topics that interest me just as much.
