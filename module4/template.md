# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Archery


What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Could get average arrow or match scores by geographic region.


2. Trend related to the news
Tokyo 2020 is coming up, any data that relates to the previous Olympics could be interesting.


3. Who does that?
Data for archery events isn't indicative of a proportion of the total population due to how it's structured. A few people from each country, a few people of different genders, etc.

4. Answering a question people care about
Some people care about arrow averages and performances over the year, some might care about match score win rates.


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?
I would love to do a brand frequency analysis but they do not seem to record this data.

7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
The biggest misconception is that archery is easy. Point at the target and shoot. As long as your sight is on target, you will be on target as well. That is not the case.
This mostly comes from people who had experience with archery at summer camp or school events with fiberglass bows at 10 yards max. Archery at high levels of play involves shots of up to 90 meters sometimes, against a relatively small target, with a tiny tiny margin for error. Hitting in the gold requires precision down to 1/10th of a degree, and having such precise bow control and body control to make each shot perfectly repeatable. 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
After playing with my data, at least at a first pass, it seems to imply there's a seasonal bias in average arrow scores. We can see if this trend holds with qualifiers as well.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
We could see win rates for specific match scores. If you're down 3 points to 1, what are you chances of winning? Does that chance change with different levels of play?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
The World Archery team has already given me access to their tournament API

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?
I am no astrophysicist, but I do know a decent amount about astronomy and care about it.

What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Geographic map of dark sky locations? Although I feel this would mostly be an inverse of a population map, even though there are mandated dark sky locations. It might be interesting to see if any pop up in relatively high person per square mile areas.

2. Trend related to the news
Modelling the dimming of Betelgeuse in relation to past trends.

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
I think the biggest misconception is that this is a field only for people with PhDs and scientific journal publications. While that's certainly true in some areas like gravitational wave observations, there's a lot of smaller and easier to grasp topics as well.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I could perhaps go into historical data. Tracking and plotting the accuracy of varying measurements over the centuries.
