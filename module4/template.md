## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

The number of Tesla vehicles purchased by people per year.

The types of cars that people are looking for. (hybrid, gas, hydrogen, electric)

6. What's the most popular?
The most popular alternative energy vehicles.

7. Cost/Money rankings
cost of different energy sources over 10 years.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Many people think we are many years away from an affordable high performance alternative energy vehicle.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I am impressed that Al Gore tried to make a whole movie about climate data, as important as it is.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I suppose but I feel it's only because time has shown that the trend is accelerating.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I think you could try to find points in time of major acceleration.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I think you could make a movie about the anthropecine extinction.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
For the car topic I could probably find some consumer data from the department of energy.
For the extinction information it would be much more difficult.
