## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

There is a lot of debate around asset correlations and portfolio develop around those assets; one misconception is that a 
concentrated portfolio of correlated assets will outperform over periods of low market volatility, however, there is research 
to suggest that when correlations approach one, portfolio performance is negatively affected.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Anything that has to do with disproving commonly held preconceptions of the majority; if there is research to suggest that 
some long held belief is disproven, that story is very intriguing to me.


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes, there are so many different hypotheses that I can create and test when identifying asset class correlations over time.


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Finance, and markets in particular, are always changing so there are endless opportunities to come up with testable 
hypotheses.


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

In my opinion, everything in the world is in some way affected by markets; not just financial markets, but even just the base 
level of markets where people coming together for a common goal. So there are infinitely many topics I can come up with that 
have to do with human interaction in some sort of 'market."

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news

The NBA is growing in popularity each day, and with the recent offseason, there is a lot of buzz aroud which teams have the 
ability to exceed expectations and improve their win/loss ratio and make a run deep into the playoffs. 

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about

A lot of people, including people I interact with frequently, talk about their favorite sports teams and their 
potential from one year to the next, so a lot of people would be interested in learning and talking about new statistics and 
what is implied by those statistics.

Additionally, there are a great many people who gamble on sports, so any way to generate an informational edge is welcomed by 
those people.

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That sport outcomes are impossible to predict because of the human aspect that makes up the vast majority of what happens in 
sports.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

The story about Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics is really inspiring and has changed the face of sports forever. His 
usage of data to construct a great team, with minimal salary expenditure, is almost legendary in the sports world.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

The world of sports is nearly infinite in terms of hypotheses that can be generated given a particular team, player or sport 
in general. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Again, there are so many different questions that can be asked depending on the specific aspects of the sports that are being 
analyzed. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I think the stylistic perspective of sports is useful in many domains; the ability to keep statistics over time and try to 
match different variables together that may be more beneficial together than apart is very useful. For example, in the work 
world, if there is statistically significant advantage to paying your workers more, and giving them the ability to work from 
home whenever they want, that's something to consider when deciding what perks to offer employees for retention or the like.
