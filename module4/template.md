## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about

   Maybe do this what type of businesses use health care more

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Could be construction workers see health care providers more than office workers

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I like ones that use maps:  Such as I found one that was a map of New York City's noisest neighborhoods with ice cream truck noise 
complaints

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

I wonder if there was a way to find the healthies or happiest neighborhood.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Maybe the question of where the ice cream trucks are most  (by noise) and the correlation to health weight of new yorkers in those
areas

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

The above could possibly by somewhat of the same style but combine the data from surveys to new yorkers around the city about 
their health with the data of the sound complaints from ice cream trucks

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

--- I could search in open data for new york city

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## Richard Olson

What do you know about?

What decisions do you face?

    Another one that I am interested in where people from the NBA come from.  Are the majority

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Can't be healthy with certain types of jobs

For the basketball one. It is not necessary to go to a large school to go to the NBA
