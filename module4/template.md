# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

Sports. Football. Fantasy football. Team/player projections and predictions.

What do you know about?

I follow NFL news as well as player and team trends.


## Seven templates

2. Trend related to the news

There are many narratives about "hot" vs. "cold" teams and players. How accurate are these? Could a data-driven approach confirm or debunk these?

4. Answering a question people care about

Could a specific strategy be implemented that would give someone an edge in weekly "pickem" pools, or in betting markets?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

People may be biased towards or against:
- individual team loyalty
- preference for style of play
- coaching, infrastructure
- hot vs. cold teams
- team vs. team matchups
- injuries

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/

https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020

https://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Using a team's ranking/performance score (e.g. 538 link above) and/or historical betting lines, can we predict a game's outcome better than by educated guessing?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

- Betting lines could be scraped from the web

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

Baseball, MLB salary cap, team construction

What do you know about?

I follow the Minnesota Twins most closely, but also keep up on baseball news and results more generally.

## Seven templates

2. Trend related to the news

Currently, the MLB free agency is in full swing (pun intended), with many different teams choosing to add or subtract different players to the roster. Is there a way of estimating whether Player A is a relative good or bad addition?

7. Cost/Money rankings

Different teams have different roster needs and salary cap constraints? Is there a best "bang for your buck" roster construction strategy? What is the marginal value, marginal cost of player additions?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

- People often view each player on a team (and dollar spent on each player) independent from one another. Despite the lack of salary cap in baseball, teams are often faced with (self-imposed) budget restraints, causing the opportunity costs of dollars spent to be often overlooked. 
- A team can only carry so many players on the roster, and so player additions often come at the cost of more marginal players. 
- Player upgrades are often position specific, so an addition at one position, often means not upgrading at another (due to the budget restraints described above). What priority should be given to what players, on which teams?

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Most anything from Baseball Prospectus, or Fangraphs

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Fangraphs/Baseball Prospectus both publish team/player evaluation statistics
- this could possibly be used to calculate a teams need at specific position, or a player's potential impact

Player salary, salary projection data is readily available

**I am leaning towards the 1st proposal, as I know how/where to get the data, and have a general idea of the questions I am looking to answer, and how to answer them**
