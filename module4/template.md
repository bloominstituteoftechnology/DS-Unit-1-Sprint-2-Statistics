# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

Also, see my new website! It's not pretty at all yet, but I'm very excited to have my own domain name: lorischlatter.com


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Gender-based violence response & prevention

What do you know about?
Dynamics of this type of violence, specifically sexual assault / the way systems function and respond to sexual violence in Kansas City and St. Louis

What decisions do you face?
How do we prevent this type of violence? What has worked in the past? What is not working now? What are effective responses? How do we create the most trauma-informed approach?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Are urban or rural jurisdictions more likely to file charges and ultimately convict for sexual assault cases?
Is there any city in particular that has better prevention efforts?

2. Trend related to the news
Has the #MeToo movement impacted the likelihood that perpetrators face consequences?

3. Who does that?
Are those who commit sexual assault less likely to be able to correctly define consent? 

4. Answering a question people care about
Does the number of tweets about #MeToo correspond to .... something?

5. Valuable to businesses
What responses are most effective to sexual harassment in the workplace?
What is the productivity lost by folks who leave their job due to harassment or assault?
(Do the demographics of a company relate to the company's success?)

6. What's the most popular?
Which city's rape crisis center(s) sees the most clients per capita?

7. Cost/Money rankings
?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
People have all kinds of misconceptions about gender-based violence -- that victims are to blame for instances of violence, that it's highly likely that someone would be falsely accused of sexual assault and risk serious consequences, that the criminal justice system is an effective form of justice for these types of crimes, etc. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
A lot of them do, actually! I just don't know where I could get the data for a lot of it, or if a lot of the questions have already been answered by other studies ... I'll go with #5.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Hypothesis: businesses lose money by not handling sexual harassment cases properly (yes I realize this is absolutely not something I could prove or disprove with this assignment)

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What is the impact of sexual harassment trainings on reported cases of sexual harassment?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
What is the correlation between sexual harassment investigations in a workplace and employee retention rate?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
This would be the tough part... but I could try Uniform Crime Data, National Intimate Partner & Sexual Violence Survey, etc

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
workplace satisfaction

What do you know about?
Lots of anectdotal things! I've had experiences in great work environments and really terrible ones. I've become a lot more curious about the topic because of those experiences.

What decisions do you face?
What factors predict workplace satisfaction? What are the results of workplace satisfaction / dissatisfaction?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Are there different cities that are more likely to have higher workplace satisfaction?

2. Trend related to the news
? 
Maybe more related to generational changes rather than just hot topics in the news?

3. Who does that?
Are there different career types that tend to have higher workplace satisfaction?

4. Answering a question people care about
Does having catered lunches increase overall workplace satisfaction?

5. Valuable to businesses
What are the key factors that predict employee retention?

6. What's the most popular?
What is worker's favorite perk or benefit?

7. Cost/Money rankings
What is the most cost effective way to provide more options that employees want?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Honestly, this is something I'm still learning about! I would be learning along with everyone else

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I'm really curious about the factors that could correlate with employee retention

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Employees that report higher work satisfaction are more likely to be retained.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Is the number of 'perks' a workplace offered actually correlated with employee satisfaction or retention?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Is employee satisfaction correlated with overall company success /profits?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
This is what I'm not sure about ... maybe just do some googling to see if any open source data exists on employee satisfaction / retention? I've done this briefly but haven't found anything super promising so far.
