# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

I wrote three, but all three are closely related. I think the first one is the best, monsters are cool and the CR system is one that has known mathematical problems that could be solved.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

# D&D Monsters

## You

**What do you care about?**

D&D, Playing Games, Random Generators

**What do you know about?**

D&D, Games Systems, Random Number Engines

**What decisions do you face?**

What combination of monsters to pit against my players for a challenging yet fair competition.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

**Can you apply the templates to your topics?**

1. Geographic Variation

 If virtual environments count - then yes. This could be very useful.

2. Trend related to the news

 Not unless I can count Nerdarchy.com, or other sites like it, as a news source.

3. Who does that?

 Dungeon Masters: Alpha Nerds

4. Answering a question people care about

 YES. The current D&D CR system is both complex and difficult to implement on-the-fly during games.

5. Valuable to businesses

 Only one. WoTC

6. What's the most popular?

 na

7. Cost/Money rankings

 na

## Misconceptions

**What misconceptions do people have about your topic?**

D&D has fought many misconceptions over the years, including a proclaimed association with devil worship. Thank goodness this can't be farther from the truth.

More closely related to my particular idea is the misconceptions that the CR system is completely broken. I would say it's only a little broken.

## Examples

**What data storytelling example inspires you?**

Inventing something new and showing it off.

**Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?**

Yes

**Could you do a new question, for the same topic?**

Yes

**Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?**

Yes

## Data

**Where could you search for data about your topic?**

I will generate data for a custom game system based on the open source D20 rule system.
