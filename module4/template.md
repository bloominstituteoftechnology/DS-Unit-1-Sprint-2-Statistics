# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

Renewable Energy

What do you know about?

It comes from multiple sources, all with different generation capabilities/drawbacks/potential/etc. 
It is a large and growing field as we transition away from fossil fuels.

What decisions do you face?

Not personally: How to allocate our resources most efficiently.
Personally: Maybe whether or not to invest in solar panels for my home.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

How does renewable energy potential/use vary geographically?

2. Trend related to the news

What are the trends of prices/company valuations/adoption rates in the field?
Which political parties are pushing renewable energy?

3. Who does that?

Who installs solar panels on their home? What companies/governments are investing in renewable energy?


4. Answering a question people care about

What mix of renewable energy should we invest in as a society?

5. Valuable to businesses

What mix of renewable energy should we invest in as a business to increase profits?

6. What's the most popular?

Which type of renewable energy is the most popular?

7. Cost/Money rankings

What are the different costs of renewable energy? What kind has the largest margin for profit?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That renewable energy can immediately replace fossil fuels and maintain base load power without the use of a non-renewable generation source.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://blog.usejournal.com/untapped-potential-making-the-u-s-an-energy-leader-378b387263fa
This example from a past student inspires me because I know I can tell a much more nuanced and in-depth story.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Is it cost effective to try and capture ALL potential renewable energy sources in the US?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

What is the most effective energy generation mix to take us off fossil fuels?
Which renewable energy sources should be used where? -> What is the point where they become cost effective?
How do different renewable energy generation methods compare in terms of life cycle emissions?
How do different renewable energy generation methods compare in terms of levelized cost of electricity?
How does weather and time of day effect renewable energy generation?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

In that style, I could analyze the increase in GDP if every adult in the United States worked all potential hours of a normal 40 hours work week.

## Data

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

Soccer

What do you know about?

Popular sport that I love to play and watch.

What decisions do you face?

What teams/leagues to watch and how to train to play my best.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Geographic variation in interest/time spent watching or playing soccer.

2. Trend related to the news

How has popularity of soccer in the US changed over time?

3. Who does that?

What type of people watch and play soccer?

4. Answering a question people care about

How do injury rates and long term impacts compare to other popular sports like football?

5. Valuable to businesses

Why are the best teams the best? How to indentify the best players?

6. What's the most popular?

How has the most popular team/player changed over time?

7. Cost/Money rankings

What are ticket prices like? Who is the most expensive player? What makes a player or team expensive?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That Americans don't like soccer.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://medium.com/@yroo/betting-on-elo-ratings-268e0bbef7e2

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

I could try to recreate the Liverpool metric where they predict the effect a player's touch has on the likelihood of a goal being scored.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

I could look at the ELO based betting history for soccer.
How good of a metirc is xGoal or xAssist? 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I could apply the ELO article's methods to other things that use ELO like video games.
