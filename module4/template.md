# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

-	Quality healthcare amongst women, people of color, income, other demographics

What do you know about?

-	Research has proven that women and people of color have a harder time receiving proper care, having their voice heard/addressed, pain taken seriously. Higher mortality rate in women giving birth amongst people of color – biggest disparity amongst Black and Native American women.

What decisions do you face?

-	Hospital/health provider choices, living distance to hospitals with good reputation, seeking multiple opinions of doctors, advocating for people more vulnerable to inadequate health care.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

-	By state or city, which states/cities provide more fair treatment; also, is this tied to political party of state
-	Demographic and distance to hospital
-	Is this different by country

2. Trend related to the news

-	Coronavirus treatment/testing
-	Mortality rate of minority women giving birth
-	Waiting times in emergency rooms
-	Treatment times/options for diseases more prevalent in women/minorities
-	Public funding for diseases more prevalent in women/minorities

3. Who does that?

-	Everyone uses the healthcare system
-	This information would specifically impact minorities and women
-	It could be used to create movement for reform across the system

4. Answering a question people care about

-	People should care that everyone is getting fair treatment. Whether it is for yourself, a family member, a loved one or a neighbor.

5. Valuable to businesses

-	Useful to healthcare industries to address flaws in their practices
-	If a company establishes itself as the premier care for women/minorities it would see increased patronage for people who are frustrated by the system

6. What's the most popular?

-	Look at the most popular healthcare solutions for minorities/women

7. Cost/Money rankings

-	Costs should be standard across all demographics
-	Insurance costs/availability based on demographic

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

-	Misconception that people are treated (in a medical sense) equally regardless of gender or race (a disease is a disease)
-	Implicit biases in healthcare workers, e.g (women complain about pain more)
-	Access to healthcare (financial)

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Mortality rates of black women compared to white women in varies health care situations
https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/2018/sep/focus-reducing-racial-disparities-health-care-confronting

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

-	Women of color receive lower attention in health care leading to higher mortality rates

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

-	How quickly do women of color get diagnosed vs white women?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

-	Car prices difference between women and men

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
-	Kraggle
-	Dataset google search

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

-	Coronavirus testing for everyone

What do you know about?

-	People are struggling to get proper testing, this is leading to delayed treatment, further spreading etc.
-	Affluent people seem to have no issue getting tests

What decisions do you face?

-	Whether it is safe to go outside
-	Whether to go get tested or not
-	How those you know are being treated

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

-	Are different cities testing at a faster rate?
-	We know that different countries are testing at different rates, is this effecting containment? How much?

2. Trend related to the news

-	Obviously, coronavirus and its spread is all over the news
-	Making testing more accessible will ‘flatten the curve’

3. Who does that?

-	We’ve seen the affluent have more access to tests. Celebrities, sports teams seem to have no problem getting tested even if they have no symptoms
-	Normal people who are sick and are showing all symptoms are struggling to get tested

4. Answering a question people care about

-	Answers the question of having access to coronavirus testing

5. Valuable to businesses

-	Everyone should be concerned with this topic. If we are able to contain the spread and deal with the disease, businesses won’t be affected as much

6. What's the most popular?

- Don't really have a question about popularity for this topic

7. Cost/Money rankings

- Does testing cost differently per person/demographic?
- Is it cost prohibitive?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

-	That coronavirus isn’t a big deal
-	That healthy young people don’t need to worry about it because their mortality rate is low
-	That testing and treatment of coronavirus is easy and straight forward

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

US lags behind in Coronavirus testing
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/us/coronavirus-testing-data.html

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

-	An unconcerned general public result in low coronavirus testing

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

-	After a slow start, have we caught up to the testing rate of other countries?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

-	US adoption rate of a new technology compared to other countries

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

-	Google Dataset search
-	Statista
-	Kaggle
