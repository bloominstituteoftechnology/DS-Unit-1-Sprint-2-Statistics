Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

I care about education on the macro and micro level.  By macro, I'm referring to municipality-, state-, and country-level performance. By performance, I mean metrics such as attainment, attendance, standardized testing results and demographic parity of those metrics (gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship status, etc). 

By "micro" I mean education at the classroom level.  This can often be divided into student and teacher perspectives (though there is natural overlap).  This could mean a focus on curriculum choice, job satisfaction, teaching methods or student retentions, academic performance, learning motivation, and/or physical or social environmental factors and their effects on learning. Crossing fields, it also lends to 
  - a focus on cogntive psychology, particulary in memory-related subfields such as research related to cognitve load theory (CLT)
  - Learning analytics (which involves the collection and analysis of student performance data).  In the modern context, an interest in learning analytics goes hand in hand with an interest in learning management systems (LMSs)
  
For the record, I'm more interested in the micro-level at this point in my professional trajectory. 

What do you know about?

During my doctoral studies (in the field of Comparative Education), I learned a lot about internatinal differences in education policies and the varied sociopolitical contexts that shape the formation of those policies as well as the socioeconomic factors that can bias the collection and interpretation of qualitative data. 

What decisions do you face?

Trying to learn how to work with quantitative educational data and how machine learning and other DS technique can assist in this goal. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

It is very common to see studies that discuss education as it relates to location.  So if I found a dataset that discussed, inner-city truancy rates, I could perhaps choose a single city and analyze the data or analyze specific variables across regions. 


2. Trend related to the news

The pros and cons of "School Choice" is a major topic of debate among educationists way before the current presidential administration.  Considering the current administration decided to promote school choice, the recent [supreme court decision to take on a case that can affect the funding of school choice initiatives](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2020-01-21/the-high-court-takes-on-school-choice) is something worth following.  However, I'm not certain what usable and/or relevant datasets are out there to capitilize on the controversy of this subject.  

3. Who does that?
Unrelated theme.  Unless I explored what types of institutions tend to use what type of LMS.  


4. Answering a question people care about

I suppose you could look at past statistics to predict the likelihood that a person born into a family with a specific income level (or even better, a certain *equity* level) will reach a certain education level. 

5. Valuable to businesses

For "edupreneurs" and well-established ed-tech companies, data related to academic performance is an increasingly important topic. 

6. What's the most popular?

I could ask something like. What's the most popular LMS? or What's the most the most popular MOOC for learning X? The latter question has been covered well, I think, by others. 

7. Cost/Money rankings

Themes 6 and 7 seem derivative of the same underlying theme of "What's the most?", but yeah could ask what's the least/most expensive method of attaining a specific job title.  


## Misconceptions

The Coleman report, which was released in the 60s found an direct correlation between family income and the academic achievement.  This may not be so surprising.  What is surprising is that little has changed about this ground "truth" many decades and countless studies later.  Thus, any attempt at improving academic achievement must first do battle with this correlation or seek to overcome it.  

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I like following [David Venturi](http://davidventuri.com/data-science-masters) and his websites and blogs showing how he created his own personalized data science masters program by taking a series of MOOCs. It shows his progress and is usually rather visual. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

If the hypothesis is, can I become a data scientist through MOOCs? I suppose I couldn't because the question is dependent upon too many variables and would require too much of a committment to simply meet the end goal of visualizing my journey on a blog. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

If there were a survey out that asked career professional.  "Did you get your job largely because knowledge obtained through MOOCs?" and got other data such as gender, length-of-study, geographic location, etc., then that would be awesome.  But no, I couldn't do the same topic for my study. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I suppose I could.  Kinda looks like he used bootstrap but I could be wrong. I'm not sure about coding behind customizing a post on [medium](https://medium.com/)
## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

For my topic, which strangely hasn't been asked about up to this point, I'd probably use [Google datasearch](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
urbanization

What do you know about?
That many cities are growing (but some are shrinking)

What decisions do you face?
None

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
This theme is ideal for subject like urbanizatin because it can be visualized on a map. 

2. Trend related to the news
You can get tons of results on "urbanization" by using it as a search term in news.google.com.  It's one of those topics that doesn't really become less relevant over time. 

3. Who does that?

Who does urbanization? People "does" urbanization. :)
4. Answering a question people care about
People may have concerns relating to increases in crime, rent, enthnic makeup as it relates to the flow of individuals to cities for work, retirement, and education.  (I'd assume mostly for work.)

5. Valuable to businesses

New people carry with them new consumer expectations.  For example, a store selling cheaper goods may flourish over a store selling "higher quality" products if an neighborhood with new-city arrivals seeking employment. In other words, tracking changes in demographics and total population  can be relevant to specific business questions.   

6. What's the most popular?

You could ask a question like.  What's the most popular city for entry-level tech employees that has a housing rate under some specified amount.

7. Cost/Money rankings

I'm sure you could find a dataset that ranks cities based on cost-of-living.  This could be comparied to a list a cities with the highest/lowest rate of urbanization. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I'm not sure if there are any misconceptions of about urbanization.  Maybe one could explore if urbanization is often used in negative articles or positive articles by using NLP to search for certain words and make classifications. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I haven't found a good storytellig example on urbanization

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I could once again use Google datasets.
