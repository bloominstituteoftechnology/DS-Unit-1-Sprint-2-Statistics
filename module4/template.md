# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

I care about Bitcoin metrics (not price related) that can be found on the bitcoin blockchain. More specifically, utxo trends (when created, distribution), hashrate trends (asic implications, mining power by country/mining pool, asic efficiency trends), and adoption trends (I know this can be overdone with price, but maybe a new and interesting perspective is possible).

What do you know about?

Bitcoin ecosystem, internet/social media's effect on geopoliticals and govs with a more totalitarian bend (for example...Hong Kong movement/Iran internet blackouts), and monetary economics as a whole (dollar, yuan, ruple, bitcoin, etc).

What decisions do you face?

I need to hone in on one thing that I think will reveal an interesting trend while avoiding analysis that has been over done. With these topics I think there is probably a ton of readily available data (relatively). I also need to find a good place to get my data from. Bitcoin is great as it is a global public ledger. Monetary data is also probably easy to find. Analyzing social media/internet trends country is probably going to be a little harder. I know there are some services that measure internet connectivity by country. It would be cool to measure this data agianst the countries politics.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Yes. I think the conclusions I'm most interested in are the ones that reveal differences between countries.

2. Trend related to the news

Somewhat. The dominating news tends to have a very narrow frame now days... But Bitcoin trends are interesting when compared to the political instability inherent to fiat currencies (fed policy/Trump tweeting about monetary policy).

3. Who does that?

Mainly...the tech savy, cypherpunks, libertarians, younger people, more first-world.

4. Answering a question people care about

Yes, Bitcoiners care about this. Extrapolating Bitcoin trends into the future (not price but other metrics)

5. Valuable to businesses

Possibly? More likely not.

6. What's the most popular?

Yes. The Bitcoin ecosystem is fairly large, and perhaps I could compare specific products/services (hot/cold wallets, compare vs the alternatives).

7. Cost/Money rankings

Yes. Would love to have a conclusion that reveals something about the monetary differences between monies/countries/etc.

## Misconceptions

Tons. Technical sophistication required is fairly high. A lot are unaware of Bitcoin's inner workings so a common rebuttle is it's likely to be shutdown by nation-states or will be replaced by a superior product. I think the data would reveal otherwise.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Regarding Bitcoin...

https://twitter.com/repoocsov/status/1220452696173568005 (Attempting to gather more data as I'm sure there are more influential articles I'm forgetting)

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Maybe? The conclusions I'm interested in are ones that reveal something about Bitcoins trends (growth)

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

I think so. Maybe a new way to reframe the data to reveal something not noticed before.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Probably, there is so much research to be done and the data is readily available for anyone.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

- The bitcoin blockchain, either selfhosted or from an api (good one is via blockstream.info)
- Exchange price data (danger of being overdone)
- Internet/Twitter trends

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

Computer chess programs level of play/repitoire and how it related to what the top level players are playing. Interested in improving the level of chess computer programs.

What do you know about?

I know about the top players and the level of chess computer programs. It is an interesting time for chess where the computers are getting better faster and faster, and in order to compete the top level players are relying on these programs to reveal what was hidden to the human eye in famous positions.

What decisions do you face?

What to focus on.
What data to use (which top level programs), specific positions to analyze, rating trends (computer vs human)

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Not really.

2. Trend related to the news

Not really. Some implications with artificial intelligence.

3. Who does that?

Chess players/AI interested people.

4. Answering a question people care about

Yes. The total number of possible chess games/positions is a number much larger than current computers can analyze. Where does this trend end given more computation?

5. Valuable to businesses

Chess related business/chess computer program developers

6. What's the most popular?

Doesn't apply so much.

7. Cost/Money rankings

Yes. It would be interesting to compare the strengths of top programs and players.

## Misconceptions

I think people are largely unaware of the progress thats been made. Back in the 90's the top player was on par with the top program (Kasparov vs Deep Blue), now the top programs are close to 600 rating points higher (FIDE) which is huge.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

I think most agree on the computer/AI trends in chess. I think there is room for a slightly new hypothesis that would reframe.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Maybe. The data is pretty specific. Ratings and positions. Would be hard to think of a different question to ask.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Chess is an easy game to start at for computer data analysis as it's 2 dimensional and fairly easy to encode the data. AI has implications with all top level e-sports not just chess though. The same frame of mind could be applied to similar games (Look at the Dota program that was created).
