# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

Question: Does the dissemination of news on animals testing positive for the coronavirus affect pet abandonment rate? 

Hypothesis: Yes, more pet owners are willing to abandon their pets one way or another (leaving them in the streets, dropping them off at shelters) after hearing news on animals testing positive for the coronavirus, than under normal circumstances. 

Potential Problems/Alternate Explanations: 
1. Difficult to determine whether any particular pet owner has come across the news. 
2. Alternative explanations could include job loss/loss of income, leading to the inability to care for pets. 

Scope: Should this be considered within just the US or across countries?

Any Upsides? Perhaps consider uptick in pet adoption rates. 

## You

What do you care about? Animals


What do you know about? Owning a pet


What decisions do you face? 


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation-Is there some variation between different parts of the world or different parts of the US? 


2. Trend related to the news-Increased number of news about animals contracting the coronavirus


3. Who does that? Pet owners


4. Answering a question people care about--hopefully


5. Valuable to businesses--animal shelters, pet stores, pet breeders


6. What's the most popular? N/A


7. Cost/Money rankings-N/A


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? All pet owners treat their pets like family members. 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? News articles on this topic


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? Yes, the alternate hypothesis that pet owners are not exffperiencing any effects from the coronavirus that would cause them to abandon their pets. 


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? Yes.


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? Possibly, but I can't think of one right now. 


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? The internet, news outlets, animal rescue/shelter websites, and calling animal shelters.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

Question: Does age affect metabolic rate?

Hypothesis: Age affects your metabolism. 

Potential Problems/Alternate Explanations: 
1. Difficult to go from correlation to causation. 
2. Alternative explanations could include other issues related to age, i.e. stress level, sedentary vs active lifestyles, children vs no children, genetics, etc.
3. How to measure metabolism--is it only weight gain or is there another measure that may be more reliable?

Scope: How many age groups should be considered?

Any Upsides? If hypothesis is able to be verified, then consider ways to combat the effects.  


## You

What do you care about? Health


What do you know about? I'm gaining weight more quickly as I'm getting older. 


What decisions do you face? How much action I need to take to combat the effects of age on metabolism. 


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation--is there a state-by-state variation of the effects? If so, could it be state culture, the climate, the local diet, etc., that could be an alternate cause?


2. Trend related to the news--all over the girly magazines
 

3. Who does that? It could affect everyone, but is there variation between the effects on men vs women? And between age groups?


4. Answering a question people care about-this might not make for the best first-date conversation.


5. Valuable to businesses-Yes! Combating your metabolism is big pharma business! But also health and nutrition influencers, etc. 

6. What's the most popular? N/A


7. Cost/Money rankings-N/A


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? People just stop caring what they look like as they age?

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? Girly magazines, my own personal experience. 


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? Yes, the alternate hypothesis that age does not contribute to metabolism. 


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? Yes, that age may be correlated, but other factors are more causative than age. 


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? Yes, any questions relating to age as it affects health. 


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? Probably not girly magazines, but definitely scientific journals, any data collected by health apps, data disseminated by hospitals, etc.
