Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Stock trading. My wife and I started getting a little into stock trading about a year ago. And so far we're not really good at it. Mostly because we don't want to lose substantial amounts of money. Usually we tend to hold on to certain stocks for to long and by doing so we miss the right mark to sell. 

What do you know about?
Healthy understanding of the basics in economics and general stock exchange.

What decisions do you face?
- Which stocks to invest in.
- When is a good time to buy a particular stock.
- When is a good time to sell a particular stock.
- What is the safest point/value at which to sell and still maximize profit.
- Can this be predicted within reasonable bounds?
- if reliable prediction is possible, can it be automated?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
Yes, I think the average person trying their hands on stock trading faces the very same issues on where to invest their money in, when to buy stock, and when to sell it. Having a undertstandable prognostic would make it much easier to get started.

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
The misconception is that only experts in economics can do stock trading efficiently. That it is very risky, and one has to do it at a bleeding edge in order to make a profit.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Detecting Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. I saw a project in which somebody wrote code to detect if patients have parkinsons based on health assesement data.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
As this would be a machine learning project, I could try improving the accuracy of predictions, and the stage of disease progress.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
The international stock market generates a wealth of data, so i'm certain I could find something similar.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Any company that goes public publishes their stock data. So do individual stock markets.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
My wife is the former Chair of the international non profit organisation SGAC.
Space Generation Advisory Council is a nonprofit organization focused on developing a global student and young professional network in the space sector. The volunteer organization develops and executes international/regional/local events, scholarship opportunities, and leadership development positions focused on discussing the latest issues in the space sector and fostering the next generation of space leaders.

This organization is largly volunteer run, and aside from 3 location fixed larger conferences, most events are happening within regional groups. The location of these events is largely based on a rotating system, which is not very efficient or convenient for most members.

What do you know about?
Members of SGAC are in a constant flux, some members age out, others join constantly, ans so das the destribution of members. The organization keeps track of geographical data of their members.

What decisions do you face?
The question would be where regional events should be held based on the location distributions of a given region.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Yes the members of SGAC would benefit from knowing where other members are located, what they're up to, and so on. This would be beneficial to provide stronger networking oportunities and local exchange. The organization leaders would benefit from knowing where to allocate funds too.

2. Trend related to the news

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I think Ryan or Josh mentioned a project where african women relied on a hotline chain in order to determine on where to go when in labor, and how a colaboration created a map that advises these women on where to go, and organizes mods or transportation.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I could analyze "fluctuating" changes of populations on a global scale, this could include fluctuations of product sales, production or general assesement of where specific products are exported too.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I have reached out to SGAC and wiull receive access to their member location data.
