  the "Answering a question that people care about" is most appealing to me.

  ???

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

  yes: "which NFL team has performed the best against the spread over the past x years?"

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

  yes: i think that this style is applicable to many topics.

Where could you search for data about your topic?

--- I have found a dataset on Kaggle for NFL betting. I could search other sports sites to find the data but would most likely need to create my own dataset.
