# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

## Compare and Contrast
I would be doing a qualitative analysis in either case but the Pew one would be a bit easier because I've already put that data into caregories which is the most time-consuming part. And it's an analysis I've wanted to do for a long time but waited until now because I wanted to be able to use python to do the quantitative analysis part more professionally. I'm 99% certain I'm doing the Pew Internet Attitudes survey data.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about? I care about qualitatitve analysis.


What do you know about? I know about theme coding.


What decisions do you face? How to choose themes and make reproducable guidelines for how to sort qualitative data pieces into themes.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? - For qualitative research I'm going with a Pew dataset about internet attitudes that I'd previously done the theme coding for. I think it's a good way to show the power of qualitative analysis.

1. Geographic Variation - If geography is included in the dataset, I could definitely compare geographic groups.


2. Trend related to the news - Sometimes the internet is in the news. Right now, not so much.


3. Who does that? - I started with doing t-tests between people who chose to take the survey in Spanish and those who took it in English though I also plan to do the same with age and employment at the very least.


4. Answering a question people care about - This is sort of interesting data because it was pretty time-consuming to make the themes and put category codes on each response so it's unique and gives a lot more detail than the original pew analysis of why people value the internet.


5. Valuable to businesses - The first topic I'm exploring could be valuable to business. I've found respondents who prefer using Spanish value the internet for economic tasks (those related to work or entrepreneurial activities) more than those who prefer using English, at a statistifcally significant level. My next step is to figure out if this is related to self-employed status as immigrants in general tend to be more likely to be business owners. If that's true, it means SaaS companies catering to SMBs would probalby generate more revenue if they catered to business owners who prefer to use Spanish when it's an option because it's an important niche.


6. What's the most popular? - I can easily rank themes by the most popular. I'm not sure how interesting that would be.Probalby if I made sub-categories in the themes those would be more interesting horse-race wise.


7. Cost/Money rankings - Doesn't really apply.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? - In general, people discount the value of qualitative analysis because they assume it requires less math and don't feel it has large benfits compared to close-ended survey questions. The point of this is to show when you have a large sample, once you get your categories coded, it's the exact same analysis except you've just engineered a few more columns of the most telling/interesting data in your entire dataset.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Brene Brown.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
There are many hypotheses I could test with this dataset. For example, do women value connection mroe than men?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I could also look at the smaller sample of respondents who gave reasons why the internet is bad for society and ask, why do Americans think the internet is bad for society?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I could use this style on any survey data with at least one open-ended question.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I found this dataset on Pew from the 2019 Internet Attitudes Survey.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about? Disinformation


What do you know about? I have an intuition for twitter because I'm on it a lot and I have a degree in international relations which included mandatory history courses about warfare and such and I've been following what Russia has been doing.


What decisions do you face? FiveThirtyEight made a database you can find on kaggle of million of IRA tweets. I'd have to decide how to handle such a large amount of data. Do I figure out an NLP project using the whole dataset or do I pull a smaller ~2,000-tweet random sample and do my normal qualitative analysis process or do I do both, starting with what I'm most comfortable with?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation - Where do the accounts claim to be located?


2. Trend related to the news - With the upcoming election, Russian interference/disinfo is often in the limelight.


3. Who does that? - Who do IRA operatives pretend to be when posting?


4. Answering a question people care about - I have no idea on this. Probably if I did the theme coding something interesting would jump out at me. 


5. Valuable to businesses - It would potentially be valuable to social media companies needing to see patterns in IRA posts.


6. What's the most popular? - What were the most popular topics of Russian trolls in 2016 is something that's already been done.


7. Cost/Money rankings - I can't think of anything related to this that I could do with a qualitative analysis.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?- They don't realize this is old techniques scaled with new technology. Essentially Russia does the same thing Harold Hill does in The Music Man when he goes among the crowd throwing out statements about why the town needs a band and then they agree and repeat them until they believe they came up with the reasons on their own. But on a massive scale.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
FiveThirtyEight did some preliminary analysis of the dataset that inspired this idea for me.


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I don't really have a hypothesis for this yet. I first have to roll around in the data and get inspired.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
The basic horserace question of what do IRA trolls tweet about most is still a pretty good one. I'd go a step further in my analysis and break it down into more granular categories and try to answer the question why do they tweet about those specific things? What conclusions can we draw about their underlying disinfo strategy from it?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
You could do an Iranian or Chinese disinfo analysis. They're just not as sophisticated so it's not quite as interesting/challenging/fun.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
FiveThirtyEight and Kaggle.
