What do you care about?

The large number of immigrants entering the United States every year.

What do you know about?

Immigration is a transforming force, which produces profound and unforeseen social changes both in the societies of origin and in the host societies, in the relations between the various groups within the host societies and between immigrants themselves and their own Descendants. Immigration is accompanied not only by immigrant acculturation processes, but also by political measures by states to control their waves. Every year the number increases extraordinarily and the government tries in every way to retain this increase.
