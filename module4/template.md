## Seven templates
Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.
Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Find locations where gun violence is highest and look at socioeconomic statistics from that area then compare to where socioeconomics differ and see if there is any fluctuation in gun violence

2. Trend related to the news
There is always a article or news story in the news about how there was a shooting or someone has died or been injured from gun violence
3. Who does that?

4. Answering a question people care about

5. Valuable to businesses
I think the implication to business is clear, how much does gun violence cost? Perhaps a breakdown of destructive cost or generative cost. For example how makes money from death and do they have a reason to stop it

6. What's the most popular?

7. Cost/Money rankings
See template 5: value to a business 

## Misconceptions
What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That gun violence is a cut and dry sum of statistical disadvantages but honestly I donâ€™t think that is true
## Examples
What data storytelling example inspires you?

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

## Data
Where could you search for data about your topic?
Not 100 percent sure yes I guessing vital records and US department of commerce are going to be good data sources
