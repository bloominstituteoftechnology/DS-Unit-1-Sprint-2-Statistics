# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Rainbow Six: Siege. It's been one of my favorite games for the past 3 years!

What do you know about?
The skill ceiling is extremely high, and the playerbase is even higher.

What decisions do you face?
If I had the right datasets, I could figure out so many different factors about the game. "What's the likelihood of the average platinum player from year 3 hitting diamond in year 5?" "What updates to the game caused people abandoning it/lowering their engagement time as a whole with the game?"

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Maybe; I could use this to figure out where most of the players are actively playing from.

2. Trend related to the news
Not political news. Maybe news about any future updates coming to the game, but I'm not sure if this would be the best approach to take.

3. Who does that?
Mostly gamers, mainly really competitive ones.

4. Answering a question people care about
If the question was "Is there a good chance I would be able to hit platinum/diamond?" then sure.

5. Valuable to businesses
Definitely; I would be able to calculate which updates kept players the most engaged v. which updates caused the game to lose traction.

6. What's the most popular?
I'd be able to figure out which operators in the game are the most popular, but they usually chart this on their own and make it public by the end of each season. Still, this is a question I'd be able to figure out for myself.

7. Cost/Money rankings
There is no way I could use this approach at all.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
People consider it nerdy and not beneficial to the world as a whole. Although I wouldn't consider it a misconception, I would consider the viewpoint skewed; people have interests and sometimes people just want to have fun. It's all a matter of perspective.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
They have graphs on Siege's website at the end of every season showing which operators were banned the most, which ones were the most popular but underperforming, and a compilation of feedback that showed the most similar criticisms. This data always tells some version of a story in a very clean and concise manner.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Of course; I'm thinking of several right now.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Definitely.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yep.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
They have older datasets online that I could access, but finding newer datasets, as far as I can tell, would be very challenging. If I can't find the dataset by myself, what I could always do is get this dataset straight from the horse's mouth, AKA I could reach out to Ubisoft and ask them directly.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
Fast moving news headlines. Right now, it's coronavirus.

What do you know about?
The numbers are constantly increasing.

What decisions do you face?
I could do a line graph for predictions using a bayesian approach.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Definitely, I could show where the virus is mostly affecting the population.

2. Trend related to the news
Of course, it's affecting the whole world right now.

3. Who does that?
Not the best approach here.

4. Answering a question people care about
Yes, though there is no guarantee it would be the right answer because of how much we know about the virus is constantly changing.

5. Valuable to businesses
I'm not too sure; hopefully companies wouldn't be trying to profit off of this misfortune.

6. What's the most popular?
Maybe; I could show what has been the popular way of treating the virus or the most popular way to handle today's climate of quarantine.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Probably, if I find how much the virus is impacting the economy.
## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
The most common misconception I've noticed is that people are saying the virus has finished when it really hasn't; countries have been saying "we have nothing to worry about" before it reaches their homeland.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I look at Worldometer's graph often to see how many people in the world, Louisiana and the United States are infected.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Of course; I could take a frequentist approach too on the same questions I would ask.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Yep; with the everchanging information we obtain, I could constantly have new questions.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes, the number of styles are endless for this particular topic.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Anywhere that the government discloses it. I know Github already has a few datasets.
