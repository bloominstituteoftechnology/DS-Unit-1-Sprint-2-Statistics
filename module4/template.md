# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
I care about sincerity, compassion, preserving decisional agency and pushing humanity to do better and greater rather than more faster. I care about animal rights and the environment.


What do you know about?
I know about psychology-- I know a lot of explanations for why people act the way they do. I know about statistics. I know coffee (making and drinking it for the last 15 years). 

What decisions do you face?
How to live an ethically sound life in a developed nation while working full time and seeking an education in my spare time. Trying to figure out what 'ethical' means to me-- balancing creature comforts with acting in a way that is sustainable and respects animals (including humans). How to ensure that we as humans are given all of the information we need to act in the best interest of ourselves and our ecosystem. Navigating issues with cultivating awareness and compassion in others without infringing upon their own rights of agency. 


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
I'd be interested to see how people solve the unique problems of their climate/food production chain in ways that are sustainable in order to help spread this information to other similar locations and potentially spread useful ideas elsewhere.

2. Trend related to the news
There are a lot of stories covering surprising unethical behaviors in big business.

3. Who does that?
I'm interested to see how different countries use different produects for the same purposes. Or perhaps how class divisions sometimes result in consumption of products which adversely and dispronportionately affect individuals in lower SES categories. For example, high-SES populations in the US using jets to fly when this is a greater pollutant, which in turn impacts those who are most vulnerable to climate change's affects (people of low SES in developing nations). 

4. Answering a question people care about
I would LOVE to answer these questions-- to investigate how machine learning is really shaping our worldview (in the form of bots, adaptive marketing, etc) and impacting our lives, for better and for worse. Also answering questions about what we're doing to curb the negative impacts of said implementations.

I'm also interested in how human behavior impacts the world; how implicit biases can change our decision-making in ways that are contrary to our best interests. 

5. Valuable to businesses
Everything I've said above could be relevant to businesses. Aside from that, I would love to look into how people use websites and interact with information they get from businesses. I could use my knowledge of psychology to help make educated guesses about how and why people make the decisions they do based on inferences from data analyses. 

6. What's the most popular?
This one interests me less than others, but sometimes there is interesting information to dig into. For instance, I read an article about how Febreeze came to be the top of the scent refresher market because they used game theory in their marketing-- by creating narratives in commercials that made Febreeze seem like a kind of reward after the cleaning process was over. These kinds of correlations between narrative + consumer response are fascinating. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
I'm interested in how human biases and perception affect their purchasing habits. Again, I like thinking about the things people may not readily consider that can affect them negatively; potentially by clarifying disadvantageous practices I could improve people's lives.


## Misconceptions

I think people see psychology as a junk science, or they think there aren't generalizeable conclusions to be found in examining psychology or human decision-making. 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I like stories that look at a specific aspect of human behavior and decision making and look at how it relates to situations with good and bad outcomes; to understand our limitations is to have the first step to move beyond them. I don't have any specific examples.


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
