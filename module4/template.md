working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Drugs used for the purpose of drug addiction treatment.


What do you know about?
Have friends/family who have been long term users of these types of drugs.


What decisions do you face?
What is my perspective - Are these drugs effective at improving quality of life or are they a sub-optimal solution?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Where are these drugs most distributed in the U.S. in proportion to the population?


2. Trend related to the news
Opioid overdoses happening in large numbers across the country.


3. Who does that?
What is the economic status of a typical user?


4. Answering a question people care about
Are these drugs effective, or just another way for pharmaceutical companies to profit?


5. Valuable to businesses
Maybe drug treatment facilities would be persuaded one way or the other.


6. What's the most popular?
What is the most used/abused drug in this category?


7. Cost/Money rankings
How much money are users spending and how much money are pharmaceutical companies making off of these drugs?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That these drugs are always limited to a certain time frame for the purpose of recovery. Often they are prescribed and used for many years.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I have never seen a data analysis of these drugs or the effects.


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
These drugs are largely effective and not often abused.


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What are the side effects of these drugs in comparison to the opioid they are meant to replace?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Are foods marketed as "reduced calories" actually better for you?

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
Effects of a sugary diet long term.


What do you know about?
The food industry has deliberately and deceptively used sugar as a method of moving products.


What decisions do you face?
Many products have hidden sugars, and deceptive labeling. Face the decision to be aware or just not think about it.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
In what states are the largest consumption of sugar?


2. Trend related to the news
Diabetes, obesity, cancer all at record highs and show definite links to sugar consumption.


3. Who does that?
What age groups are using which products in their consumption of sugar.


4. Answering a question people care about
Correlation between cancer and sugar consumption.


5. Valuable to businesses
Business value might be to position according to the solution rather than profit off the problem.


6. What's the most popular?
What product is favored among highest sugar consumers?


7. Cost/Money rankings
How much money does the food industry make on products containing sugar?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That sugar is only in certain things - most things from salad dressing, to condiments, to milk - has some sugar in it. The average American is addicted to it, and wont respond well to a product without it.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Dr. Mark Hyman utilizes a lot of interesting data about sugar consumption, addiction, and the associated health risks and does a great job of communicating it.



Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
The various health epidemics are caused as much by mental stress as by unhealthy diets.



Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
How does the body process artificial sweeteners and is it actually healthier than sugar?



Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
How linked are pornography and human trafficing?
