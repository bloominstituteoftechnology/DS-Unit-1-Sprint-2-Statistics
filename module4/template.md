**Idea 2: Health Foods - Trends, Fads, Eating Healthy for Cheap** 
Ever since I first stepped into a supermarket in the U.S. at the age of 18, I've been fascinated by the shopping habits of health conscious consumers. And how retailers market products to these customers. Since I actually enjoy shopping for groceries and eating well/healthy, I feel like I may have some good insights, and am curious to apply my intuition and data science intution into exploratory data related to this field.
