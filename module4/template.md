# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

* Is there a way, using math/statistics and prior data, to accurately predict the winning Powerball numbers?
* What are the odds of the oridinary, everyday, hard working american winning the Powerball?
* What are the most selected numbers in the Powerball?
* What is the largest amount of people to win a jackpot at the same time?
* What kind of people are winning the jackpots (i.e. income level, age, race, gender, location)?
* Are you more likely to win the jackpot based on what state you live in?
* Are the odds of winning increased if you play the same numbers each time you play?
* How likely is it to get one of the larger multipliers and is it really worth spending the extra $1 per ticket?

What do you know about?

* The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot is extremely high.
* You are more likely to get struck by lightening than to win the jackpot.
* With the increase in the number of regular numbers in Oct 2015 the odds of winning almost doubled in rarity.
* The more people who purchase tickets, the less likely your odds of winning are.
* I believe everyone, regardless of race, age, gender, or location, have the same odds of winning?

What decisions do you face?
* How to collect the data I need?
* How to graph my findings to accurately display the information I learn that anyone can understand it?
* What are the exact variables that I need to pass into functions to get the information I need?
* What are the best functions to use in order to collect the correct data vs making my own functions?
* How to word my findings in a way that everyone, even none Data Scientist, understand?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
 
  * Find out what state turns out the most jackpot winners.

2. Trend related to the news

  * How the financial health of our country right now is affecting the purchases of Powerball tickets?
  * Does the financial health of our country affect the odds of winning the jackpot?
  * Does the current economy affect the rollover frequency?

3. Who does that?

  * What are the people winning the jackpots like (i.e. gender, income level, race, location, age, etc.)?

4. Answering a question people care about

  * Is there a way to accurately predict the winning numbers of future jackpots?

5. Valuable to businesses

  * What are the most common types of businesses that are selling winning tickets?
  * What areas are the businesses located in (i.e. type of neighborhood, state, major chain, etc.)?
  * What types of products do the businesses sell other then lottery?
  * What other types of lottery tickets do the businesses sell?

6. What's the most popular?

  * Use a "bar chart race" chart to show how the jackpots have changed over the life of Powerball games.
  * Use a graph to show the most pulled numbers.
  * Plot the most often numbers drawn together.
  * Plot the most pulled Powerball numbers.

7. Cost/Money rankings

  * How much money people spend on tickets vs the return they receive?
  * How much money people spend on tickets vs their income level?
  * When are the most tickets sold?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

  * The more I play the better my chances are to win.
  * Only people who don't "need" the money win.
  * Playing the same numbers everytime increases my chance of winning.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

  * 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

  * 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

  * 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

  * 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

  * Powerball's website

  * Run my own survey for information I can not find on Google.
