Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
-behavioral health

What do you know about?
-bipolar disorder

What decisions do you face?
-how to best allocate limited resources to achieve positive patient outcomes

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
-state and private healthcare systems vary wildly in their funding and efficacy across the country
(cost of services by location)

2. Trend related to the news
-behavioral health issues are almost always brought up in the context of violent crime and suicide in the news
(graph the frequency of mental health language in news headlines over time)

3. Who does that?
-demographic breakdown of patients in the US

4. Answering a question people care about
-Is recovery possible? How long does it take?

5. Valuable to businesses
-a healthy population is a productive population. integrating aspects of behavioral healthcare into the business culture could be advantageous. Aside from that, more effective treatment could lower healthcare costs for businesses.

6. What's the most popular?
-Top treatment methods worldwide / broken down by country

-collaborative care, or “the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians, working together with patients and families, using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. This care may address mental health and substance abuse conditions, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, stress-related physical symptoms, and ineffective patterns of health care utilization.”

-machine learning can already be used to predict manic episodes:

7. Cost/Money rankings
-spending on mental health services in the US was $225.1 billion in 2019, and is estimated to continue rising.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
-"Mental illness looks the same everywhere."

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
-https://www.modernhealthcare.com/reports/behavioral-health/#!/

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Cost is rising, but is treatment effectiveness keeping pace?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Why is the percentage of people with behavioral health issues rising?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Health insurance specifically, as it relates to behavioral health services

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
-Goats

What do you know about?
-Raising goats

What decisions do you face?
-How to breed the perfect goat

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation:
There are lots of different kinds of goats in the world, with varying population densities

2. Trend related to the news:
Do goats spread the coronavirus?

3. Who does that?
various ways goats are used (milk, meat, brush control, yoga)

4. Answering a question people care about:
why are goats 'like that'?

6. What's the most popular?
Nubians, Alpines, Boers, and the rest - How do they stack up?

7. Cost/Money rankings:
Which breed is best for which use case? (hint: you can't go wrong with a pygmy/dwarf)

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That goats are stubborn and stupid. They are actually very social, intelligent, and kind.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_pwPhFvgNo

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Instead of combat viability, look at economic applications

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Why are goats still so popular, and with who?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Any sort of population could be fit to this style with enough creativity.
