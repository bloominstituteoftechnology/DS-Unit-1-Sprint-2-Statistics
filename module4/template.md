working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
My passions are sports, exercise, health and data. I'm passionate about analytics in the sports world.

What do you know about?
I understand how analytics and sabermetrics work in the baseball world. I know how advanced stats work in basketball, as well.

What decisions do you face?
I want to be able to apply analytical data in the sporting field. Baseball and basketball use tons of analytical data.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Doesn't really apply directly. Talented baseball players can be found anywhere, but there could be studies out there to see where there are an abudnance of players in certain regions of the world i.e. Dominican Republic.

2. Trend related to the news
Baseball is a sport that is gaining a ton of momentum in analytical data usage. MLB teams are always looking for data scientists and coders to hire them and obtain/create data to help their teams succeed. NBA appears to be heading in this direction, as well.

3. Who does that?
This applies to any sporting franchise who wants to incorporate analytics into their methods of thinking. Analytics in sports can show positive and negative trends, it just depends how these analytics are used. There is so much data to use to quantify any method of thinking and understanding.

4. Answering a question people care about
How can fancy numbers help teams succeed? Not all data has to be used, but it is the way it can be applied that can help a team reach their peak.

5. Valuable to businesses
New analytics are being created daily. If I show the capability to both understand and create this data, that would be very valuable to any sports organization.

6. What's the most popular?
Analytics in baseball can get complicated. The more popular "simple" sabremetrics would be statistics such as OPS+, WRC+, WAR, WOBA, etc.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Technically, data like this is available from various websites such as Fangraphs, Baseball Reference, etc. But, in order for a sports team to acquire this data on their own, they would need equipment such as Trackman, Rapsodo and hire Scouts across the world and such.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That fancy numbers have no affect on sports. For example, in baseball, yes, a hitter isn't thinking about fancy numbers as he awaits a 95 MPH fastball. That being said, these numbers can help us predict future outcomes. They use numbers obtained in the past to create a predictable future. The numbers can lie, however. But in baseball, if a hitter gets a hit 1 out of every 3 at-bats, he is considered successful. Baseball is the rare sport where failing more often can not be the end of the world. These analytical numbers can help us predict success. Whether the general public agrees with that method, remains to be seen.

## Examples
MONEYBALL!

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I think my passion and inspiration with this comes from "Moneyball" and the fact that you can use literal numbers to help predict and analyze success is a wild concept to me. Once I saw more teams adopt this style of understanding, I knew I wanted to work in that kind of field because it is just so fascinating to me.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Do analytics/sabermetrics actually help baseball teams?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Do analytics/sabermetrics hurt teams? i.e. shifting too much

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I could compare teams that use tons of analytical data compared to teams that don't use any. Or, I could compare sports and see the difference between their success.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Fangraphs, Baseball Reference, Baseball Prospectus, ESPN, MLB

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
Health, fitness, nutrition

What do you know about?
I have a degree in Exercise Science with a focus on Nutrition

What decisions do you face?
How to quantify fitness/nutrition and quality of life in an analytical method and show it can improve quality of life.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Can locate the differences in gym memberships, physical activity, healthier eating areas by state, country, etc.

2. Trend related to the news
Gyms are closing because of COVID-19, but before that, the United States of America was always thought of as an unhealthy country in terms of fitness level and healthy eating.

3. Who does that?
Gym companies, healthier eating companies can use this data and either find popular places where people like to exercise/eat healthy or they can find areas where gyms and healthier food options are needed.

4. Answering a question people care about
How can I improve my quality of life from gyms and healthier eating?

5. Valuable to businesses
More customers = more business

6. What's the most popular?
Most popular healthy eating options = grocery stores, sandwiches
Most popular gyms = LA Fitness, 24 Hour Fitness, etc.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Living more healthy is expensive. That's why people are unable to do it or tend to not do it.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That working out and eating healthy is difficult (given proper living conditions)

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
David Goggins is a good example. But it is difficult to find any data storytelling examples with this topic.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Getting adequate exercise and eating healthy are mutually exclusive in terms of improving quality of life.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Are exercising and eating healthy the biggest factors to improving quality of life?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I could look at the ratios between states, fast food restaurants, average living age, etc.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Censuses, 24 Hour Fitness data, state datas, LA Fitness data
