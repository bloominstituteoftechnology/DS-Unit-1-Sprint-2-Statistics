# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

  Competitive advantages in esports

What do you know about?

  DotA2, Hearthstone, MtG, PUBG

What decisions do you face?

  Is a specific in-game or pre-game choice going to have a positive or negative impact on winrate?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

  Esports are global, and there may be regional trends based on public match playstyle or cultural values.

2. Trend related to the news

  Possibly, but I don't know at the moment.

3. Who does that?

  In general, males from mid-teens to mid-thirties. Demos can change based on the game, though.

4. Answering a question people care about

  Players want to win. Telling them something will increase their chance of winning will help them do that.

5. Valuable to businesses

  Lots of esports content sites like to source relevant content.

6. What's the most popular?

  "What's the most popular hero to pick?" "Deck archetype to play?" "Team composition?"

7. Cost/Money rankings

  This might be applicable to real world costs, like MtG/Hearthstone requiring money to get the cards you need to be competitive. Or it could be applicable to in-game purchases (like CS:GO costs of weapons etc.)
  

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

  A common misconception is that competitive esports is only a young person's game due to reflexes etc. Personally I think it involves the ability to sink time into something - when you are young, you have a lot of free time to binge DotA all weekend and most of the week, but not so much when you have other obligations. This reduction in practice time can obviously lead to a skills gap.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

  https://www.dotabuff.com/ usually has some interesting commentary on trending topics on its front page. It's backed up with lots of competitive "meta" data that it collects. These topics often talk about winners and losers from meta changes due to updates.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

  There are a large number of more qualitative stances they take that could be argued in a different way or with a different outcome.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

  There are so many potential combinations of data points that there is an infinite number of scenarios and data points to examine.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

  Their style often involves lots of nice character art and sometimes (mediocre-looking-at-best) graphs and tables. The character art can be sourced pretty easily, and the graphs and tables can be improved greatly.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

  OpenDota, Dotabuff

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

  Market success of indie games

What do you know about?

  Lots of play time on indie games, plus I work on my own prototypes

What decisions do you face?

  How to approach marketing finished indie game products, where to sell, etc

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

  Some geographic regions sport better success for certain genres of games. Selling a certain type of game without a certain localization could be financially pointless. A bad localization (poor translation) could be disastrous from a PR perspective.

2. Trend related to the news

  Recession is probably happening soon-ish in the US. Indie game sales often go up during recessions (games are cheap and replayable, and make a good entertainment source compared to, say, concert tickets.)

3. Who does that?

  Lots of indie game studios are made of middle-aged former corporate software devs or artists, sometimes younger student groups. Players can range in age and various other demos based on genres.

4. Answering a question people care about

  "Is the indiepocalypse upon us?" (answer: it never is)

5. Valuable to businesses

  Indie studios should be realistic in their finances if they want to survive.

6. What's the most popular?

  Popularity lists are... 'meh?' in this area. Sometimes the data is obscured (steam doesn't give direct numbers usually), but if you CAN get the data (or derive it from other metrics) it can help studios see trends to work with (or scrap altogether).

7. Cost/Money rankings

  Seeing a dev-cost-vs-success metric applied across genres might be helpful in seeing if dumping money into a project can pay off, or if it is easier to cut losses and push something a little less polished but a lot more affordable to produce.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

  That great games are created by some stroke of genius. Most of the time it is hardcore iteration and play testing.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

  Many of these storytelling examples are in the form of keynote or other presentations given to a large audience. Sometimes individual studios give post-mortems of projects as well.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

  I could look to see if any external factors could have contributed to individual or group failures/successes, instead of simply internal decisions and processes.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

  I've always wanted to find out if localization really hurts or helps a game's success. I am not sure if I can find a large enough data source on this though, without compiling my own over a long period of time.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

  I won't be able to give the length of a talk that they do (an hour, usually), but I can condense important points into a few minutes.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

  There are some steam-derived stats pages out there. Sometimes, studios are very willing to talk to people about their process, and you might be able to get things like "time spent on development versus return" given to you, even if they don't give sales figures directly.
