working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
My sales job.

What do you know about?
Sales.

How to better allocate my time between prospecting via phone vs. email.

## Seven templates

No

3. Who does that?
Yes

4. Answering a question people care about
Yes

5. Valuable to businesses

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Some sales people within my organization might errantly think that one form of prospecting is more efficient than another due to unclear data.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
A data storytelling example that inspires me is actually the movie Money Ball with Brad Pitt.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I think so....

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Yes: instead of asking which is a more efficient form of prospecting, I could ask what day of the week is the best time to prospect.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I can get data from my manager about our activities as a sales team.
