# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
I care about protecting humans and finding those at most risk

What do you know about?
I know about social media, poverty, music, and magic the gathering

What decisions do you face?
Uncoutably many decisions

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

          #Template one is prevalence of domestic violence as it relates to the divide between cost of housing and single income individuals

1. Geographic Variation
both halves of VarB is subject to geographic variation 

2. Trend related to the news
Domestic abuse is always relevant to the news

3. Who does that?
far too many individuals, and finding exactly who is a question I hope to help answer

4. Answering a question people care about
People try to look away from domestic abuse, but at the same time it attracts a sick fascination in many individuals.

5. Valuable to businesses
Primarily to non-profits, but being able to aid victims of domestic violence before critical points in their life will allow a smooth transition to independence and would be lucrative to the personal loan field

6. What's the most popular?
"what's the safest economic situation to avoid domestic abuse?" 
it doesn't have a very good ring to it

7. Cost/Money rankings
this is more of a large scale loss prevention project.
abuse inhibits the economic growth of each individual effected, requiring time off work and reparitive therapy. 
if we could more accurately predict individuals in need of protection, we could reduce the social and mental repair they require.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
There are more misconceptions about domestic abuse than there are stars in the sky.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
This topic is deep enough to provide our entire class a lifetime of work.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
unfortunately yes; there is no shortage of small abuses we can dredge up.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
There is a wealth of data, from (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) to (https://www.hudexchange.info/)
