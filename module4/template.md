# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

- Fun!  Video games are my favorite pastime

What do you know about?

- What games I like

What decisions do you face?

- Which ones to play?  There's so many these days that it's impossible to play them all.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

  - Video games are mostly independent of geography.  There may be some interesting comparisons here, but data could be difficult to find.

2. Trend related to the news

  - Could focus on popular games, perhaps ones in recent news articles, recent releases, or even just ones that showed up at a conference like E3.

3. Who does that?

  - Same as geography, we don't always know who is playing the game and it may not matter.  For example, knowing what games are popular with different age ranges or cultures could be cool, but data is again hard to find on individual people.

4. Answering a question people care about

  - Is this game worth playing?

5. Valuable to businesses

  - Recommending games based on play history

6. What's the most popular?

  - Games could easily be ranked by several statistics, such as reviews and ratings, player count, copies sold, or even average play time if you have it.

7. Cost/Money rankings

  - We could compare a game's cost to several different metrics, such as sales or ratings, but most comparisons could be easily influenced by outside factors such as the amount of marketing a game had, or if it is a sequel to another popular game.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

- Many people just stick to games that are "popular", while there are tons of games out there that don't get the same attention yet are just as fun.  The connection between how much a game costs, it's genre, the time played, or various other info might not be very strong.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

- I don't know of many, but this was an interesting one: [What factors predict the success of a Steam game? (An analysis)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/buuire/what_factors_predict_the_success_of_a_steam_game/)
- It had a lot of interesting info, and actually asked several questions, but it was limited to a dataset of 115 games that the author gathered by hand and they could not always draw clear conclusions because of that.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

- The questions were all yes or no, and didn't explicitly state any hypothesis, only a conclusion.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

- With the same data, I could probably come up with one but they covered things pretty thouroughly with 7 questions.
- With more data, there could absolutely be new questions to answer.  Just depends on the data we have.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

- We could analyze other things based on review data, such as cell phones, cars, or movies.  There are a lot of possibilities there.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

- Weather, I enjoy hiking and getting fresh air every now and then

What do you know about?

- Nothing about meteorology

What decisions do you face?

- When planning things, it's good to check a forecast.  Maybe I'm deciding which day to hike, or what to do on a particular day.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

  - Of course weather varies by geography.  We could look at what kind of weather is more common in different areas, what cities get the most rainfall, or many other questions.

2. Trend related to the news

  - What the news talks about isn't going to change the weather...  Might be able to do some analysis of weather around natural disasters since those hit the news.

3. Who does that?

  - This wouldn't fit well, weather affects everyone

4. Answering a question people care about

  - Is it going to rain?
  - What is the likelyhood we will have rain in [some city] in [some month]?
  - How many days did it rain last year?  Compared to past years?

5. Valuable to businesses

  - Many businesses are affected by weather, especially in the tourist industry.
  - Another angle would be sales potential.  If you sell umbrellas, when and where would it be most profitable to buy advertising space?

6. What's the most popular?

  - Again, weather isn't different for individual people.

7. Cost/Money rankings

  - This one also wouldn't fit well, but maybe you could combine it with other data.  Such as umbrella sales vs rainfall in each city.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

- Perhaps some people get skewed perspectives and expect weather to do different things.
- People may also not know what weather is common in other areas than where they are.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

- I couldn't find a data storytelling example for weather
- I did find an ineresting article on using machine learning as an alternate to traditional forecasting models: [Using Machine Learning to “Nowcast” Precipitation in High Resolution](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/using-machine-learning-to-nowcast.html)

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

- It occurs to me to see if it is possible to create an accurate forecast based solely on what the weather actually was the last few days, time of year, and location.  This would be better for a later project.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

- For data storytelling, I could explore things geographicaly: what cities rain the most? Or I could explore it chronologically: what years had the most rain?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
