# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1
- How do car insurance rates vary by crashes, casr, regions, demographics?

## You

What do you care about?
- On average, do pickup truck drivers have higher insurance rates than others?

What do you know about?
- I don't have deep knowledge of anything.

What decisions do you face?
- No major ones at the moment

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
   - Which city/region in the United States has the fewest car crashes/capita? Which has the most?

2. Trend related to the news
   - How has the pandemic lockdown influenced car crashes/capita?

3. Who does that?
   - What is the profile of the safest/riskiest drivers – their age, car type, car color, sex, race, region, and income?

4. Answering a question people care about
   - What are the most commonly reported reasons for car crashes?
   - Which hour of the day and day of the week has the most car crashes?
   
5. Valuable to businesses
   - Do otherwise comparable drivers have significantly different insurance rates by car type? If so, how big a difference?
      - If so, a business might want to know which vehicles/specs have the highest/lowests safety when picking company cars.

6. What's the most popular?
   - What are the most and least popular cars?
   - Which car is most commonly involved in car crashes?

7. Cost/Money rankings
   - (As above, since insurance rates reflect risk) What is the profile of the safest/riskiest drivers – their age, car type, car color, sex, race, and region?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
   - The importance of selection. Certain cars may attract more risky drivers, but the risk comes more from the driver than the car. In other words, it makes less sense to talk about dangerous cars, and more sense to talk about dangerous drivers.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
   - Not quite inspiring, but I'm interested in the types of cars and people most associated with risky driving

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
   - What is the relationship between pickup truck drivers and car insurance rates?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
   - What is the profile of the safest drivers, according to car insurace rates?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
   - Who are safer drivers – men or women?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
   - Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2
In major cities in the US, which ethnic food restaurants are rated the highest? Which are rated the lowest?
## You

What do you care about?
- Food

What do you know about?
- NA

What decisions do you face?
 - Where to eat when the 'rona dies down

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
   - Are ethnic restaurants rated similarly across cities, or do some cities have particularly strong/weak types of ethnic restaurants?

2. Trend related to the news
   - Which ethnic restaurants have seen the biggest declines in popularity due to the coronavirus pandemic?

3. Who does that?
   - Who eats at the most/least expensive and the highest/lowest rated ethnic restaurants?

4. Answering a question people care about
   - Which type of ethnic food has the highest ratings in the cheap/mid-priced/expensive category in New York City?
      - That way, people can get the most bang for their buck when dining.

5. Valuable to businesses
   - Which type of ethnic food is most liked by the tech industry and financy industry?

6. What's the most popular?
   - What is the most popular type of ethnic restaurant in New York City? Los Angeles? The US?

7. Cost/Money rankings
   - What types of ethnic food are the most and least expensive in the US?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
   - For the purposes of this analysis, we'll assume away these internal differences within ethnic foods. In reality, there is plenty of variation both between ethnic foods and within them.
       - India and China are huge countries and their cusines reflect that.
   - The type of restaurants people go to does not perfectly represent the type of ethnic foods people like most.
      - For example, some people may feel more comfortable making tacos at home than pork dumplings, and due to that different familiarity, Mexican restaurant frequency may be lower than the true population interest in it.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
   - Again, not inspiring, but I'd like to see which type of ethnic foods have the highest rating across the the 5 biggest cities in the United States


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
   - What is the highest rated type of ethnic food (by restaurant) in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
   - What is the lowest rated type of ethnic food (by restaurant) in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
   - What is the cheapest type of ethnic food (by restaurant) in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
   - Restaurant industry stats
