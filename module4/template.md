# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
I care about physical health and doing things that are conducive to living a long, healthy life.
Companies like Oura Ring and the Apple Health app track biofeedback and produce loads of data.
So biofeedack, quantified self...


What do you know about?
I have a Biology degree and can understand fairly technical/scientific material in biology, physiology, etc.
I also don't get bored of these things.

What decisions do you face?
In many, many cases, we face a decision of whether or not to intervene, and how to intervene, with things that seem to have an impact on our health. Should we sleep more or less? Should we eat carbohydrates? Does cholesterol cause heart disease, and if so, is the effect size large enough that we should consider reducing our intake? And, given our limited cognitive capacity to manage things, how many factors should we actually keep track of without letting it consume our lives? At what point does stressing about being healthy become unhealthy? Should I focus on increasing lifespan or athletic performance (if the two aren't correlated). 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
"Habit hack" --> "which city is most conducive to getting my 10000 steps?"
The idea is that in a bad-weather city (my beloved Pittsburgh) you are less likely to go outside and get the oft-cited 10000 steps per day that is good for your health.
Maybe this would increase someone's likelihood of wanting to move to a city with better weather.
I wonder if I can find fitness tracker data for free somewhere?

2. Trend related to the news
Is there anything "hype"-y about this stuff? Lots of mini-hypes. Antioxidants... Metformin for longevity...

3. Who does that?
"Old people aren't walking enough; millennials impress"

4. Answering a question people care about
People love to think they "can get away with" 4 hours of sleep per night, etc.
It's a pretty hot topic right now. I forget the guy's name, but he's famously debunking this idea.

5. Valuable to businesses
...

6. What's the most popular?
Most popular fitness tracker / wearable?

7. Cost/Money rankings
Demographics on who spends the most money on biohacking/biofeedback/wearable fitness trackers, etc.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Oh, geez. All of it.
The Standard American Diet is trash, nobody sleeps enough, we run on caffeine and alcohol, we think the bench press an important exercise and that buying preworkout makes us stronger, we've demonized animal products as globally unhealthy...

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Serge Faguet's post on biohacking and his personal bloodwork results and the impact on his life.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
many

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
many

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
many. The issue with these last 3 questions is that I'm too broad for them right now. I think the availability of data is going to inform this section. I think going specific on a question beforehand is a mistake.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
https://blog.google/products/search/discovering-millions-datasets-web/amp/
Additionally, all the resources given to us in class under Biology and related.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
What do you know about?
What decisions do you face?
A lot of focus is placed on climate change, but what I notice over and over is that people are unaware that certain, very particular, things are having outsize impact. For example, we know that producing a pound of beef has like 17 times the carbon impact as a pound of chicken, or something like that. 

We face consumer decisions, but the individual impact is tiny. Companies can solve many of the world's big climate/environment issues with data, and then inform consumers and governments how much better they are than incumbent processes.




## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Palm oil is solely responsible for an absurd percentage of rainforest deforestation. (Matt Ridley, The Rational Optimist) 
The top 1000 rivers put 90% of the plastic into the oceans. (Boyan Slat, Ocean Cleanup company)
Who did these analyses and on what data sets?

2. Trend related to the news
Chinese consumption of beef is increasing. By how much? Is there any stopping it? How quickly are plant-based meat replacements like Impossible and Beyond catching on?

3. Who does that?
...

4. Answering a question people care about
All of the above examples fall into this category. People can't get enough climate change talk.

5. Valuable to businesses
The business that can communicate that it's great for the environment has a huge advantage. Tesla comes to mind.

6. What's the most popular?
Products into which the most palm oil goes, and can it be replaced with less destructive sources?

7. Cost/Money rankings
...

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Few people see this issue rationally. It has been politicized, when in reality we can innovate our way out of it and begin letting the planet heal itself. (<-- This could be a good spin)

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National park.
The video didn't explicitly give data, but it sure could be measured. Things like width of riparian buffer zones.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I've already enumerated several different ones.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I think several topics would fit well under the style/direction I talked about in "Misconceptions"

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Conservation organizations



## Compare and Contrast, Selection
I worry about the availability of fitness tracking data. I think this stuff will likely be proprietary. I think I might have better chances with conservation-related data. I need to see what's out there first. But for now, I am leaning towards my second option.
