# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
I care about public policy, and I spend a lot of my spare time trying to influence my local and state representatives to adopt sound policy. 

What do you know about?
I know a lot about healthcare spending, and I am familar with some of the data available. 

What decisions do you face?
Recently my husband's business had to scale back on employment cost due to a drastic decline in revenue. Many employees were laid off, and they had to cancel their employer sponsored healthcare plan. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
   I want to look how much US companies spend on employer based insurance in the US vs cost of finincing models in other countries to show how our current healthcare policy is bad for business.

2. Trend related to the news
  Healthcare policy is an important topic in the 2020 presidential race. Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in America.

3. Who does that?
  Who pays healthcare cost in America? What share of spending is put on the employer, employee, and tax payer.

4. Answering a question people care about
  Healthcare cost affect everyone. It is a very important topic and is often discussed among friends and family, especially after someone faces a medical emergency.

5. Valuable to businesses
  American companies have to compete in a global marketplace against companies in countries with government financed healthcare. Having to pay more than competing companiesto insure their employees makes it harder for them to compete.

6. What's the most popular?
 What are the most popular financing schemes for healthcare.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Ranking healthcare cost across states and the world.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
The biggest misconception I see is that single payer is often confused with single provider. Though I do not think it is important to the topic of how much more American businesses spend than their foreign competitors on healthcare. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
The Common Wealth Fund has some stunning insight into healthcare spending. https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2019/may/how-much-us-households-employer-insurance-spend-premiums-out-of-pocket?redirect_source=/publications/issue-briefs/2019/may/how-much-us-households-employer-spend-premiums-out-of-pocket

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
There are very many aspects to healthcare spending to explore. Once I have a greater understanding of analysis, I would love to take a deep dive into predicting the cost savings that would come with single payer healthcare.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
Another public policy topic that I am passionate about is campaign finance and government ethics. I would like to find ways to show how committee seats in the state legistlature can be influenced by contributions from industries affected by there 

What do you know about?
I am knowledgable about how our campaign finance system works both at the state and federal level.

What decisions do you face?
As a voter, I have to decide on which candidates to trust and often the best way  

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
There are many ways to breakdown campaign finance data into geographic regions. For the purpose of this assignment, I would like to focus on state level campaign finance data from representatives across the state of Washington. I would like to show how their legistlative committee assignments are linked to who their top contributors are.

2. Trend related to the news
The topic of money in politics is ocassionaly brought up in the news, but for the most part their is little in depth analysis of the problem.

3. Who does that?
Which representatives take money from industries affected by their committee assignments.

4. Answering a question people care about
The public wants money out of politics, but they often do not understand the topic enough to talk about why money is an issue. This data story would provide people with a clear demonstration of how their state representatives are influenced by the industries most affected by their committee assignments. 

5. Valuable to businesses
Not really a promotion of what is valuable to business, since the topic is more in terms of understanding how businesses shape public policy through campaign contributions.

6. What's the most popular?
Though not quite ratable as most popular, I could look as I talk about below which state legistlative committees lead to the largest industry contributions. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
An interseting money ranking that can be made is to see which committee assignments bring in the most money. At the federal level, Congressional representatives rank their committees this way. The committees are referred to by A, B, and C level rankings based on the amount of money lobbyist give in contributions. Congressional representatives on "A" level committees receive the most in lobbyist contributions. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Many people think that legistlators are placed on committees based on interest and knowledge. The truth is assignments are made by party leadership based on how much money the legistlator raises for the party legistlative caucus political committee. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
RepresentUs does a good job of using data to tell a story about campaign finance.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
There are many questions to explore with campaign finance data. You can ask the question of "who takes the most money from outside the state". I would like to focus only on the question of how committee assignments affect top industry contributions, but I talked about in terms of money ranking looking at which committee assignments lead to the most corporate donations. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
www.pdc.wa.gov for the campaign finance data
http://leg.wa.gov/ for the committee assignments for individual legistlators.
