## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Humans tend to do a poor job of understanding statistics and interpret events in a sporting environment incorrectly.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
A recent look at how certain stats said a player considered to be at an elite level defensively was actually hurting his team's defense while he was on the court.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Likely not.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I would more likely look at a different player from the offensive perspective.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes. Looking at someone who people assume is great offensively, but that further analysis may prove to be a hindrance.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Advice tends to simplify broad topics into single-sentence tips.

The data collected by calculated.gg which does a descriptive analysis of game replays.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I could present the same data with deeper analysis.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
My questions could be which values are related and most important when looking at differences between player-ranking tiers.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I could offer an interpretation of the data with more of a focus on explanation and theory-crafting than the dry presentation offered at calculated.gg

## Data

I'm looking at scraping data directly from calculated.gg
