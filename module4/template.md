# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
-----I'm interested about trends in education, such as testing and student performance.

What do you know about?
----I had been working in k12 and had some kind of exposure on this domain

What decisions do you face?
----I would like to see if I can derive some conclusion based on information that I could 
    potentially gather about the effect of testing on student performance and other related topics

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  ---- This can be an attribute that I could also explore

2. Trend related to the news
  ----- If I could find related data, I could also explore decisions related to education brought about or
        affected by different attributes available from the dataset.

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
  ---- Since money is one of the driving force of just about anything, it would be interesting to find out about educational
        expenditures.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
---- I do not know, I just have this general opinion that we are testing our students too much and I do not know
     for sure if it is really helping them.  
     I would like to look into the hidden cost of testing such as time spent preparing for it, thus time lost for otherwise 
     relatively better spread out learning experience. 
     

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
