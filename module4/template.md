# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1 - Something climate-related

## You

What do you care about?
- Chemistry
- Physics
- Climate science
- Weather & climate modeling

What do you know about?
- The general consensus among working scientists is that human activities are dramatically affecting climate
- Climate change in general is leading to higher gloval temperatures and an increase in severe weather events (drought, etc)

What decisions do you face?
- This is an extensive field of study with a ton of data made publicly available.  Narrowing the question down to a single topic will be challenging.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
- Definitely!  It should be simple to gather data from all over the world on this topic.

2. Trend related to the news
- Similar to above - climate science and the climate 'debate'have been minor, but present, players in the last several election cycles.

3. Who does that?
- Everybody who breathes, eats food or drinks water constantly interacts with the changing climate
- I think it should be important at this point to keep my project simple and focused - i.e. looking at the effects of climate change over time or across different populations/areas rather than attempting to derive the source of change
- This could be an option for a future project

4. Answering a question people care about
- As referenced above, this topic has been on the "top 5" issues list for several election cycles

5. Valuable to businesses
- Yes!  Namely for businesses affected by climate/severe weather such as the agriculture industry, fisheries, etc.  Businesses may have an interest in ways to combat their effect onn climate, but that would be an issue for another project to tackle

6. What's the most popular?
- The science itself of climate change is pretty universally agreed upon.  There would be room, however, to examine the popularity of the subject demographically or politically

7. Cost/Money rankings
- Depending on the impact to business activity, it may be possible to contrast the cost of different practices and their relative effect on climate (the cost to produce and maintain solar panels, for instance)

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- Current climate changes are the result of a natural cycle and are not man-made
- The level of CO2 in the atmosphere is too small to have any effect
- Individual practices can have a large impact on climate change (though something like the largest 15 shipping vessels produce more pollution than all cars world-wide) - again, mgiht be a better option for a study on correlation rather than on the effects of climate change

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45775309
The BBC did a piece on shrinking arctic ice including a great visualization of the size of arctic ice over time:

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
- I could - but I would be more interested in similar studies of other variables - annual rainfall, for instance. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- Yes. Polar ice is known to have an affect on global ocean temperature, ocean currents, etc - which can all impact climate in places geographically separated from the poles.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
- As noted above, it might be interesting to study something like average temperature, rainfall, wind, or the extremes of a similar variable.  It would be particularly useful to the agricultural industry, for instance to be able to predict annual rainfall in a given area.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ Would be one possible data source
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/data-sources/ is another source of several datasets

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2 - Political redistricting and the effects on voting results vs outcomes

## You

What do you care about?
- Shifting demographics
- Political party affiliation
- Congressional redistricting

What do you know about?
- General knowledge of political practices

What decisions do you face?
