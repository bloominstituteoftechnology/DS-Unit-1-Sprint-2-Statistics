# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Tennis, is the sport healthy in the US? are numbers rising in memberships and viewership or declining?

What do you know about?
Since the americans haven't been as strong, the representation in the us is dwindling. 
We don't broadcast many tournaments on public channels, ESPN rarely shows it.

What decisions do you face?
Alternative subscriptions to tennis channels that often don't cover the tournament of interest. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Absolutely, compare to european and other nations to see their trends of viewership/membership. Stratify for wealth

2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?
Tennis fans, coaches, clubs, broadcasters, sports channels, product manufacturers

4. Answering a question people care about
is it worth getting into tennis? Is my geographical location a popular tennis area?
What's the baseline number of American stars that there needs to be to hold the nation's attention?

5. Valuable to businesses
Should they build more beginner friendly equipment or focus more on the intermediate players, 
what percent of sales and profit is due to these segments? Is it worth dedicating more coverage to non-US tournaments?

6. What's the most popular?
What are the most popular tennis racquets? Highest viewed non-US tournaments? 

7. Cost/Money rankings
Which nation makes the most from tennis?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Tennis is boring, nobody watches it, it's only for the rich.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6
the Jeff Kao findings looks pretty much like gold to me. Pretty mind-blowing what you can set up to 
uncover a simple fraud

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
What, the same question as the example? The proportion of faked comments is 95%

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Who is faking these net neutrality comments? Is this legal, what are the consequences?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I'd like to know how much sjw backlash is actually fabricated
