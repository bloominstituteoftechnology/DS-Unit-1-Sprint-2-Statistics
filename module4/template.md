# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
- Cryptocurrencies/macroeconomics

What do you know about?
- Investing/trading/risk management

What decisions do you face?
-When/what to buy, when to sell

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  Could look at crypto purchases in different countries

2. Trend related to the news
  Scrape the news for a gauge of crypto sentiment/adoption

3. Who does that?
  Identify the biggest traders and track their transactions

4. Answering a question people care about
  What is crypto's long term potential? What determines its real value?

5. Valuable to businesses
  Can make money knowing what and when to buy or sell, also if the crypto's applications can provide value to their company

6. What's the most popular?
  What are the most widely used and/or widely traded cryptos?

7. Cost/Money rankings
  Can compare transaction fees of cryptos, trading exchanges, as well as the profits to be gained from mining a given crypto.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- That its unsafe, just a fad, and has no real value


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
- Jeff Kao's example is inspiring, because he uses data science to filter through millions of posts and figure out which are likely to be faked. This is a very useful tool, considering how hard it now is to know what's real on the internet.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
- I could try to prove the opposite but he's already found that around 99% of pro-neutrality posts are unique.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- I could ask the same thing but for social media, and find how many of the social media posts are authentic.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
- I think it would be useful to write a general "bot post detector" that would tell me what posts on any given site are likely to be generated by bots.
