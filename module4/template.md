# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

 * computer security

What do you know about?

 * abysmal performance security-wise
 * why so many exploits / vulnerabilities

What decisions do you face?

 * how to assess what risks you take with X software / technology

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

 * availability of secure software in your area
 * export controls on cryptography and such

2. Trend related to the news

 * are major breaches / incidents happening more often
 * or just reported more

3. Who does that?

 * microsoft has a real time threat repoorting tool for the whole world
 * possibly other companies as well
 * maybe look for collections of reported data breaches 

4. Answering a question people care about

 * am i safe?
 * are there steps i can take to minimize risk

5. Valuable to businesses

 * is this business safe
 * how to minimize risk
 * what's the fallout if this business gets breached

6. What's the most popular?

 * find rankings of attacks by type or tool in attack category

7. Cost/Money rankings

 * what's the damage like for companies that fail at security
 * is it lasting or does it go away with the news cycle
 * how much time/money os required to achieve X level of protection / assurance

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

 * no need to worry about giving out my info, they're a big company, they'll protect it
 * writing safe software is hard
 * building secure systems is hard
 * i'm good at technology so i'm good at securing technology

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

 * gotta look into this

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

 * google
 * microsoft
 * virustotal
 * anti-virus / anti-malware vendors
 * exploit-db / vuln-db
 * malware authors
 * pen-testers

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?

 * maximizing reward for effort

What do you know about?

 * i know that i want to determine how to do it, on purpose, measurably
 * actually doing it would probably be good, too
 
What decisions do you face?

 * am i benefiting as much as i can for doing this work
 * where might i benefit more
 * how might i benefit more right here / right now
 * what constitutes benefit?
  * money
  * satisfaction
  * recognition
  * amount of effort
  * time
  * lack vs surfeit of freedom vs responsibility

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

 * if i expend the same effort in a different location?
 * salaries / benefits / opportunities based on location?

2. Trend related to the news

 * rise / fall of remote work
 * rise / fall / sustainability of high-reward jobs
 * what people find more rewarding

3. Who does that?

 * digital nomadism
 * tech industry job hoppers

4. Answering a question people care about

 * how to find out if my current rewards are at a maximum
  * what do others make doing the same thing (around here/elsewhere)
  * what types of benefits do other places offer that mine doesn't
  * what extra efforts might be required if i alter my situation
 * how to find out what other benefits might be available if i changed my situation
  * location
  * remote
  * just switched companies

5. Valuable to businesses

 * what are people prioritizing as far as rewards
 * what should i do to attract my ideal employee
 * are there things with little cost to me that can increase my percieved 'reward value'
 * if i relocate, can i get better / cheaper employees
 * where can i find other ways to increase the benefits i offer while minimizing the cost to me
 
6. What's the most popular?

 * can i increase the rewards i care about by joining a group, even if their ideal rewards are not mine
  * their side benefits = my ideal benefits vs effort to belong

7. Cost/Money rankings

 * this all falls in with everything above

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

 * i'm stuck
 * i make too much to risk change
 * effort:reward ratio is too high

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

 * gotta start looking

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

* insurance providers
* tourist info about areas to determine intagible side benefits
* lists of compensation by industries / skill-sets
* info on company growth
