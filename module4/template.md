Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Fitness, nutrition, longevity, scientific integrity, why certain things seem to be increasing in cost so much faster than everything else (healthcare, tuition, infrastructure building), productivity, sleep, quantified self, soccer, meditation, punishment/deterrence in US prison systems.

What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
How does happiness vary throughout the United States? By region? US vs elsewhere? Urban vs. Rural?

2. Trend related to the news
How is happiness and/or life satisfaction affected by drug/alcohol use?

3. Who does that?

4. Answering a question people care about
How does the class environment in which you grew up affect current life satisfaction/happiness?

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
People claim they want to be happy. However, they often do not act in strategic ways to maximize their chances of happiness. This data set can only support correlative, not causative, associations, but I think a deeper knowledge of what life conditions associate with happiness and life satisfaction can help people orient themselves appropriately. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/2019%20SSC%20Survey.html

Though this is a decidedly unrepresentative sample of the world, this is a data set of 13,000 readers who answered a battery of questions about their lives and also entered both "happiness" and "life satisfaction.

The GSS reports life happiness as part of their data.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
How do punishments for comparable crimes vary by state? How do recidivism numbers vary by state?

2. Trend related to the news
Have rates of gun violence substantially changed over time?

3. Who does that?
How do the number of prosecutors and/or prosecutorial backgrounds or electoral factors impact sentencing length?

4. Answering a question people care about
Do states with more severe punishments see lower rates of re-offense or crime in general?

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
Which places cost the most and the least to lock up prisoners (per day, total). 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Misconceptions:
1) "Long sentences provide an important deterrent effect." In reality, there are two major drivers of effective punishment: whether a sentence is quick and whether a sentence is consistent. The difference between imprisoning someone for 8 years or for 25 years
2) "Imprisoning people for nonviolent drug offenses is a major cause of US carceral state." In reality, nonviolent drug offenses make up a tiny fraction of those imprisoned. Substantially reducing 
3) "For-profit private prisons and their lobby are what prevent reform" - The size of all private prisons are utterly dwarfed by the size of public prisons. The revenue of private prisons is outweighed by the salary and wages paid to people who work for public prisons.
4) "People who commit certain crimes are bad people almost certain to reoffend." In reality, recidivism rates for even violent crimes tend to be lower than people think, and steadily go down as people age out of peak ages of criminality.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
John Pfaff's work digging into root causes of these issues. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What reforms would lead to lower incarceration rates?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Bureau of Justice has many statistics:

Not sure. I'm more fascinated by the happiness data (it seems less "solved"), but, at the same time, the crime data would be easier to tell a story with, and most interesting happiness data to me is the blog survey, which is going to allow for less clean population inference. Both of the official data sources are government sources, so 

Honestly, I might end up looking at some sort of sports data set -- obviously that's played out, but I have access to some semi-public data that I'd be interested to look into. The downside is that really isn't data of social import, and exploratory data analysis of sports data is going to tend to be obvious to one set of people and of little interest to another set.
