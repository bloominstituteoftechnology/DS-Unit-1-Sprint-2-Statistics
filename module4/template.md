# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
*The NFL.*

What do you know about?
*It is "common knowledge" that passing performance decreases in outdoor games.*

What decisions do you face?
*How to construct the hypothesis test in the face of confounding variables.*


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
*YES: this can be part of the slicing & dicing.*

2. Trend related to the news
*Kind of? Home-made stats are kind of taking off in the fan community.*

3. Who does that?
*NAH*

4. Answering a question people care about
*Kind of?*

5. Valuable to businesses
*ABSOLUTELY: Free advice on what matters when preparing for game day--where you don't have to waste your time.*

6. What's the most popular?
*NAH*

7. Cost/Money rankings
*I could probably come up with something cute, but I'm drawing a blank.*

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
*The idea is to examine a popular assertion: People think throwing the ball is harder when you have to deal with the elements. Like all superficial analysis, it makes sense. But does frequentist statistics support it? I guess the misconception is that there are demonstrably no misconceptions.*

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
*[Is 'Buy and Hold' a Good Investment Strategy?](https://medium.com/@daniel_carter/is-buy-and-hold-a-good-investment-strategy-fe2d43266bb5) for the way he explains his methodology and what those choices mean.*

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
*Passing performance is more impacted by geography (ie, lat-long) than being outdoors.*

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
*Is kicking performance affected by the outdoors?*

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
*Are you really saving money by stocking up on sales as opposed to just buying what you need when you need it?*

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
*Pro Football Reference*
