# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
- I am passionate about the game of football. It doesn't matter if it's the NFL or the NCAA.

What do you know about?
- I am an avid fan of both leagues. I may not follow every team, but I can call out most players and their stats, and
  what plays are going to be ran.

What decisions do you face?
- I need to narrow down the topics of interests that would carry the most data. The possibilities are limitless i.e., the 
  average salary per position, team cap space from west coast to east coast (same with positional players), what does it 
  take to be drafted #1? Those are the kinds of situations that I find the most interesting.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  - I would say yes. The reason why? I could get ann idea on how different players are paid in comparison to being a Midwest, 
    East Coast or West Coast team, as well as, how different the team caps on salary are compared to where the team is located
    in the United States.

2. Trend related to the news
  - It actually depends on where they are at in the season. After the Super Bowl, it solely turns into the FA market - who you are 
    and how well you performed during the season, and if you made it into the playoffs. 

3. Who does that?
  - I'm not sure that I would be able to use this template. There are a lot of people who have questions, but this template I don't
    think would apply to what I am trying to accomplish.

4. Answering a question people care about
  - This one is borderline possible. Some care about how much money the players get paid, and others care about how much the players
    are getting over paid. In all honestly, I don't think that I would use this template.

5. Valuable to businesses
  - I could use this one. Demogragphically speaking and being from Seattle, I know that a lot of local businesses based the prices 
    of the product that they offer depending on what team is local, or if they don't have a team - then they base it on what they 
    feel is the team that will draw people in most. For example, I know of several local bar and taverns that based on the team the 
    Seahawks are playing and what day the game is, they base the specials for the day and adjust the prices to bring in more people. 
    Again, this is just another aspect of the game that drives the economy and sets the standard.

6. What's the most popular?
  - Out of the possibilities that I have written down vs. what I have seen locally and on a much larger scale, I would say that the 
    most popular would be the average salary of an NFL player based on the position that they play. There are 8 positions on the field 
    when it involves the offense. Ranging from a league minimum of $275k to the highest paid that could be $30million per year. It's 
    obviously a very broad set of data to tackle but I think it would be interesting to tackle. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
  - When it comes to the average cap space of an NFL team I would say yes. Again, I truly believe this comes down to a geographical 
    aspect and the economy, and how the team is doing. If the team isn't doing so well, then typically they drop the cost of a single 
    game ticket to draw the crowd in; vice verse, if they are doing well then the prices typically will rise on a gradual basis.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- The only misconception that I actually have about this is - does it really depend on the geographical position of the team in order 
  for a data set to truly have any meaning or validity. Yes, there are players that are always in the spotlight and those players 
  make more money in a single game than a typical american will make in an entire decade, but that doesn't stop teams, players and 
  unions from asking for more money.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
- Richard Barth actually has a pretty cool data story telling example that he uses for a play-by-play for the NFL. 
  https://richardbrath.wordpress.com/2019/04/28/data-comics-with-nfl-play-example/ ... It doesn't necessarily complement what I am 
  trying to get to, but I have an idea of a data set that he uses from football analytics.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
- I probably could if I were to go about it a different way. I'm not sure that I'm experienced enough to create a plot to that extent.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
  - I would actually ask what play is ran the most between conferences (NFC West, East, North and South - and the same for the AFC)?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
  - I honestly cannot answer this question. With me having no background in the Data Science world, I need more time and more exposure
    to be able to come up with a new topic with this type of style. 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
  - I know that overcap.com has a list of QB's and their contracts. Ranging from the highest paid to the lowest paid; for example, 
    Russel Wilson makes an average per year salary of $35 million while the lowest paid salary is Drew Anderson of the Cardinals at
    $500k per year on a 2yr salary. So there is a wide range, and I could create my own data set to where I could average out the 
    salary of an NFL QB (I've just narrowed down a topic question - What is the average salary of an NFL QB?)

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
  - What is the average divorce rate on a second marriage?

What do you know about?
  - I know that I have been married once already and that I want to make sure I know what causes are associated with a divorce 
    in a persons second marriage. I don't want to make those same mistakes and I feel that it's important that people realize 
    the risk that is associated in a second marriage and the risk of divorce. 

What decisions do you face?
  - I need to tread lightly because it's more than just a sensitive topic. Like politics, people get amped up when it comes to 
    talking about finances, sex, and divorce. I need to be able to approach this from a personal point of view, but also a 
    non-biased point of view if that is possible. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  - I am going to say yes on this one. If I am able to separate the data on a coastal type of data (i.e. Midwest vs. East & 
    West Coast), then I should be able to define the probability of divorce rate by region.

2. Trend related to the news
  - Usually the only trend related to a divorce is either infadelity, financial or just straight up growing apart. I would 
    say that being able to use this template would have to be split 50/50.

3. Who does that?
  - While this isn't funny, I am getting married for the second time. I have spent countless hours researching the causes in 
    why a couple who gets married for the second time would get divorced. 

4. Answering a question people care about
  - There is absolutely no hesitation in answering yes to this template. It's a question a lot of people ask themselves when 
    they get to a point in when they are ready to start dating. This template would most likely be my first choice to use.

5. Valuable to businesses
  - I wouldn't use this template at all. I don't see how it would be beneficial in making them money if they were to read my 
    article or blog post. From experience, I know that the only business that would make money wouldn't read my article, and 
    that would be the bar scene. 

6. What's the most popular?
  - It's possible that I could use this template if I were able to come up with contrasting topics that would appeal to the mass.
    The likelihoood of me actually using this template would be slim to none.

7. Cost/Money rankings
  - The only way that I see using this template would be a deterring factor, in that it costs a ton of money and there is a lot 
    of emotional spending that goes into a divorce. So no, I wouldn't be able to use this template. Again, I've been down this 
    road so I have experience in knowing what people want vs not wanting when it comes to information.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
  - The most common misconception is people have this idea that I've been through a divorce once before, I know what I'm doing 
    and know what NOT to do. I know what I'm getting myself into and what I want it too look like, but I have no control over 
    life and what i'm dealt. I know to be honest, to communicate and to always choose my spouse - anything else I'm asking 
    questions.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
  - I'm not sure if I am supposed to be using examples for the topic or from the lecture this morning. In doing some research on 
    topic I have one in mind that I have always been drawn to. 
    https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/state-divorce-rates-90-95-99-18.pdf
    The numbers are staggering, so if I could incorporate data and use a personal story to attach to it and ways that data shows 
    we could avoid such a high rate of divorce, then I'm all about it. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
  - This one doesn't have a hypothesis, so I am going to have to take some time and actually come up with one. This is something
    that I am very passionate about and know that it could benefit so many people. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
  - There would be one question "Divorce rate by State, What can we do different?"

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
  - I wouldn't want to do a new topic. This hits home and I believe in helping people for the greater good.
