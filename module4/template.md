# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about/ What do you know about?

Disc golf, for the sake of the assignment analyzing the professional scene


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

4.) Answering a question people care about

What makes Paul Mcbeth so dominate?


## Misconceptions

There are a lot of aspects about disc golf that can make a person great. I don't think there's much debate that Paul is the best player,
but people have many varying perspectives as to why. 


## Examples

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes, though I don't believe I'll have to. There isn't room for bias in this hypothesis, but as I eluded to in the misconceptions, there are many reasons that will contribute to why Paul is the best player, we just want to see how many of these categories he peaks. I think that he'll rank highly among many of the top categories, but I believe his putting, and more importantly his outside circle 1 putting, that will give him the greatest advantage.


## Data

UDisc has every major tournament recorded back to 2016. Ideally i'd like to go further back than that, but ~4 years of good data will 
still be able to reinforce the narrative.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?/What do you know about?

The NFL, primarily the San Francisco 49ers

4. Answering a question people care about

Where must the 49ers improve the most this year to win the 2021 super bowl


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I don't believe people have any misconceptions about the topic, other than the 49ers flat out not making the superbowl. Which, I mean 
is very possible, but they made the super bowl this last year and I just want to focus on where they can improve. 


## Examples


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Yes, such as 'Is Garropolo good enough?' analyzing our quarterback, arguably the most important position on any nfl team, comparing him to other "non-elite" qbs that have won the super bowl before and exploring the stats of the team around them. 


## Data

Kaggle has a great NFL dataset that stems back to 2009, but if I need to find more specific data, there is no shortage of specific NFL
datasets that return from a quick google search.
