# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?
*I would say I know a lot about fantasy football / fantasy football drafts*

What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?
  *There's a good deal of discussion on which drafting strategies are best (i.e. who to take first)*

7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
  *New players will often over-prioritize QBs in early rounds, but I also think experienced players over-prioritize TEs in  early rounds

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? *The "Playcalling in the NFL" example*


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? *The example asks the question:"Should teams 'Establish the Run'?" while testing a hypothesis that they should pass instead. Another hypothesis could be that there's a certain type of run play teams should be using in the early downs (i.e. middle, outside, toss, QB-run, etc)*


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? *Should NFL teams "go deep" more (prioritize passes of 15+ yards)?*


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? *Which position/player type is the most valuable in fantasy football?*


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? *Possibly the NFL website, ESPN, Pro-Football-Reference, Yahoo

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about? *I love cinema!*


What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about: *If a movie makes a lot of money in the box office, does that have an impact/relationship with how they fare at the Oscars?*


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? *Not yet sure if a misconception, but I think people generally expect that big-budget or big-box-office films don't get much critical recognition, and the awards mostly go to smaller, "Indie" projects.*


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? *The "Is 'Buy and Hold' a Good Investment Strategy?" example*


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? *The writer's hypothesis was that it's not a valid strategy unless a person is born at the right time. Another could be that 'Buy and Hold' is never an optimal strategy.*


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? 


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? *Does a big box office haul impact a film's chances at the Oscars?*


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? *boxofficemojo.com, infoplease.com
