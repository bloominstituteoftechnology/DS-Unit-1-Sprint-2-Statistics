# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

I am very interested in the casino industry.


What do you know about?

I feel I am pretty informed of how the casino industry operates.


What decisions do you face?

There is a lot of data in this field, so determining what tells the most interesting story will be the most difficult part.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Differences in revenue between different gaming markets.


2. Trend related to the news

New casinos opening.


3. Who does that?

Who is actually visiting the casinos.


4. Answering a question people care about

Economic impact to region of casinos. New jobs, crime, gambling addiction, etc.


5. Valuable to businesses

Analyze trends in what patrons are spending their money on, to potentially predict where more effort should be focused.


6. What's the most popular?

Could analyze how well sports betting has done since being legalized in many states recently.


7. Cost/Money rankings

Could look at revenue for the casino division vs food/beverage/hotel, and see what the trends are overtime.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I think there are many misconceptions regarding the casino industry. Specifically, opponents always first point to the increased crime rate, or the potential to get people addicted to gambling. It is seen as a negative strain on the local ecnonomy. But what is often ignored is the positive ecnonomic impact that all the new jobs a casino brings, and all the tax money that helps the community.
