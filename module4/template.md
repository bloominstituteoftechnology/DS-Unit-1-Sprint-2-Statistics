# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

## Options

### What do you care about?
- Art
- Video games
- Stories
- Guns
- EMS
- AI and the progress toward AGI
- Infosec
- Computer Hardware
- Computer Software
- Drones
- Rock climbing

### What do you know about?
- Video games
- Stories
- Guns
- EMS
- Computer Hardware

### What decisions do you face?
- Where to go in the world
- What to do
- How to get there

### What do you want to know about based on these?
- Art: How long it takes to become a good artist by time spent woprking on it (Probably just the 10,000hrs thing as usual)
- Video Games: Something with EVE Online? It's usually a great start for data. What's the spread of gamers across different genres? RPG, FPS, RTS, Puzzler, Side-Scroller, etc. (Probably something already out there on that, and also difficult to get data on that)
- Stories: Spread of genre's against the population? (Really not sure with this one)
- Guns: Do more guns = more crime? How likely are you to die to guns vs anything else? How likely are you to die in general? (Last one is probably the most formed idea I have for this so far)



# Idea 1 for data storytelling - How likely are you to die?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
California counties sorted by year. Keeping it small because gathering the data for it was time consuming.

2. Trend related to the news
If you believe what's going on in the news people believe they and their kids are more likely than ever to die from a shooting. Is that actually the case? Are we actually viewing the world as it is, or are we off the mark?

3. Who does that?
Not applicable, I think.

4. Answering a question people care about
Not applicable? I'm not sure that anyone is going to be talking about how likely they are to bite it in a cocktail party. Not unless it's the punchline anyway.

5. Valuable to businesses
It may if you find a company that has some relation to fear of the future. For example, if the results come out to be horrible you might be able to share it with a company that sells products to prepare and protect yourself. If not, maybe some type of medical company to show why certain behaviors are impoortant to manage if for instance some disease proves to have a large share of deaths by comparison.

6. What's the most popular?
Hopefully living is the most popular! We don't want to find a net-negative basically anywhere in the data, but other than that the single most deadly stat/group of stats can show where we might want to turn our attention.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Not applicable, I think. Not related to selling anything specifically.


## Misconceptions

At least as it appears in the news, people seem to believe we're dropping like flies to all manner of things, especially to gun violence. Then again, I've had people I know also talk about it in a similar way.


## Examples

### What data storytelling example inspires you?

The second is approximately how I'd like to set up my display, though I want to have the option to click and change the graph to show what you need. For example, A donut graph on the left that shows all deaths plus total population minus the dead. After selecting a category it could break out on the right to show that group in more detail. This is kind of a lot to do though so I'd have to wokr up to that.

### Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
My current hypothesis is that deaths by violent crime account for much less than simple medical disease, maybe even standard traumatic death unrelated to crime.

### Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Most deaths come not from the older population, but instead the younger generations. I have no idea if that's right, but I'd be curious to find out.

### Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I'm not sure with this data, it's already pretty focused. I'm sure any population with many subsets could be used like this though.


## Data

CDC, FBI, unsure about any other databases.

# Idea 2 for data storytelling - EVE Online Stuff

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
A key metric ranked by city, state, or country. Create an index based on your company's core data asset and see how it varies by geography. For example, if you’re a car rental site, you can rank cities by where rental cars are most expensive.

2. Trend related to the news
What are reporters dying to write about right now? What do you know that is relevant to a story or topic dominating the news cycle? For example, do you have some data related to the election’s aftermath?

3. Who does that?
A demographic breakdown of how people use your product or engage in an activity you can track. This is the right template if your product is particularly interesting and its usage is representative of the market. If your company sells marijuana, for example, who buys it?

4. Answering a question people care about
I always wish I knew the answer! These are fun analyses based on your data that you could imagine people discussing at a cocktail party. A dating app might explain how many messages, on average, users have to send to get one date.

5. Valuable to businesses
If businesses read your article, will they make more money? For B2B companies, this is the dominant template for content marketing. Can you benchmark conversion rates, things that lead to higher sales or lower costs?

6. What's the most popular?
Market share rankings and “horse race” data. There is something particularly satisfying about definitive rankings of what is the most and least popular thing in a category people care about. If your company monitors grocery store transactions, what are the most popular cereals? Is it Lucky Charms?

7. Cost/Money rankings
What is the most expensive? Who makes the most money? If you sell dolls, which brands sell for the most money in the secondary market?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

### What data storytelling example inspires you?
So many of these. It's a shame I can't actually grab any of these anymore since the links are broken, but it's rediculous the amount of data and work being done in each of these slides.

### Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Lots of questions in there, but I'm sure I could for one or two.
https://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/65749/1/productionVsDestruction_2013.png
For this one I get that we're seeing the production and destruction, but it's hard to tell if any are net positive or negative. I'd like to see a version that compared them to get a value in the end, and then determined how that affected the in game economy. People talk a lot about how things have stagnated and there's too much power with certain people, but I believe it's the nature of reality that these things end up being stuck in one group or another. After all, it's already happened in the real world; we're not exactly seeing a regieme change every decade.
I wonder if you can make a statement about that with this, or if there's any better way of showing that.

### Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Which coporations account for the destruction in each system?

### Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
https://jsfiddle.net/ccpquant/LGqLG/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=LGqLG
Link to the place where I can mess with the source.
For the topic, maybe which things are being produced?


## Data

I'd need to use the EVE Swagger Interface and their API to pull data from their servers. Not 100% sure how that works but it sounds like I can get it done.
