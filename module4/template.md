# Ideas for data storytelling 

Note that I wrote more and mention 2 different paths in 1 sheet, compared to splitting them up into two sheet ( some portions really only require one answer for both paths I may go along

## You

What do you care about?

Video Games is the first thing that comes to mind. I think that video games can be a good way to to call people to action, but more generally mediums of communication in general are interesting to me, but I’m not sure how to translate an interest in styles to data science. Global warming and relatedly energy are also interesting to me. 

What do you know about?

Engineering, Video Games, Books, Computer hardware to some extent, “Sciency” stuff… relevant ones would be renewable energies.

What decisions do you face?

What industry to join/ apply for jobs in.  How to best leverage my time (maybe look at cost benefit of various activities. Getting data for this would be hard, because knowledge compounds and future value of current knowledge isn’t clearly known)



## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings

1) I could apply the really almost any template to questions realating to global warming, and energy. For example. Who does solar power best? Who is the best in terms of reducing their carbon footprint? How are the energy needs across the world, and what sources do different parts of the world have access to?  What is the cost / value of some renewable technology?


2) Within the realm of video games I can also ask a lot of interesting questions. Geographically what is the distribution of video game players? What is the distribution of genres of games among various demographics? What is the most popular game within genre x ( the interesting part of this question isn’t particularly the answer, it is how you collect and analyze the data, because I think that critics have a big say in “popularity” but I’m not sure what the results would be if critics scores were cross validated with sales. Additionally it would be interesting to figure out how to model limited customer (real players) reviews to figure out how the customer base reviews are biased, and get a better idea for what the “general populace” thinks about a genre. (a starting point for this would be further investigation into “90% of the content is produced by 10% of the people on the internet”).)



## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
1) I think the main sources/ contributors to pollution, as well as perhaps, the main places that we as individuals can make a difference are unknown. For example I’m actually not sure what contributes most to global warming, and I would need to find a good data set about that. Additionally What is the best source of renewable energy? What is effective? I think there are a lot of “ideal” statistics like if we had solar panels in some small area of the world we could power the whole world. These data points aren’t often useful because sure we could build a ton of solar panes near the equator, but how would we distribute that power to the rest of the world. There would be a ton of loss in a system like that. Maybe its more feasible to go with wind, or geothermal, or perhaps in the short run, nuclear. 


2) I don’t think people that aren’t heavily invested in the video game industry take games, and game industry data too seriously. I think that consumers play video games for the most part, and their interaction with it may be to the extent of “ what new game should I place” but the problem with the industry is that its growing rapidly, but the search mechanisms we have/ advertising mechanisms don’t deliver stories to the right people. What I mean by this is that there are probably many games out there that an individual would enjoy, but the algorithms that decided what to suggest to the individual are not the best. The “indie game genre” for example has a lot of variety in it, but because games are classified as “indie”  a consumer might actually reject them.  The labeling system is causing inherent bias, and those who do want new games are having trouble sorting through all the options to figure out what to play. This is the game industry’s equivalent of the “Netflix problem”. Where you spend more time looking for what you want to watch instead of watching, and because the “hunt” stresses you out you relax with shows you know are in your “strike zone”  I think the cool think about this question and its associated data is that it applies across the entertainment industry, not just to video games. 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

1) Say the question is:  “ Who does solar power best”. My hypothesis would be to come up with a list of countries that do solar well, and then source information about the countries, their economies, and populations to some extent, their solar power history, and any policies they may have for solar power. I would try to do this for all the top contenders. The initial hypothesis would be my gut feeling, but other hypotheses would just be other countries.  Perhaps countries I didn’t have in my initial list, that I would then go need to collect more data for. 
2) For video games say the question is “ what is the best video game for the 21+ demographic? ” Alternative hypotheses in this case would just be different games. The answer might have to be by year, which would then introduce the question: Should we ask “ what is the best game for this generation” or for the demographic. Because generations move through the age demographic, but the industry often mirrors generations, not demographics. For example  Naughty Dog evolved as a company with their audience. Their audience was the same group of people as they grew up. (I played the latest Naughty Dog games as I grew up, and their themes and content got more mature as I became more mature)

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Yes I have tons … see above.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I think both topics can be done with multiple style, but again it depends on the question you ask. I have a nexus of questions, the next step is to narrow this down into specific questions that I can 



## Data

1) I know Germany is big on nuclear, I also know that governments, and perhaps the UN often conducts studies about global warming, and energy. They would be a good start.

2) For video game data there is the steam database which has an api. This would give me access to information about existing games like rankings, tags, user responses, cost, development year and so on. If I combine that information with some sort of “development cost” database (if an accurate one exists) then I could make some interesting observations. If I want to ask more granular questions about individual games instead of the industry Dota 2 has “opendota” where you can ask for match statistics. This would be a large data set to comb through but I could ask interesting questions on the scale of a game instead of on the scale of the industry
