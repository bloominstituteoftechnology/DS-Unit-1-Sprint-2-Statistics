# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about? I care about Neuroscience and memory formation.


What do you know about? Basic Neuroscience and psychology topics.


What decisions do you face? Diving in the deep end and finding a dataset that fits these interests but could potentially 
be exceptionally difficult at this stage of my training or just going with a basic, easy dataset I know I can work with 
while possibly learning something new on a topic I wouldn't normally touch upon.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation - Possibly: certainly the psychological aspects could be touched upon here.


2. Trend related to the news - Neuroscience is frequently in the news, as is psychology.


3. Who does that? - This topic is particularly important in nearly every professional setting, especially in education. It is important to understand how the brain works, especially regarding memory, attention, etc, to help educate the mass populace on a particular idea, product, what have you. 


4. Answering a question people care about - I am possibly biased because certainly I care about this topic more than the vast majority. That being said, education should be the forefront of everybody's mind. If we are not educating in a way that allows us to learn productively and effeciently than time, money, and energy is being wasted by all parties.


5. Valuable to businesses - It is very valuable to businesses. Understanding how to educate your workers in a way that trains them to your liking benefits the employees as well as the business itself. 


6. What's the most popular? - I'm not entirely sure how to answer this one.


7. Cost/Money rankings - 


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? 
- Everybody learns the same, or in a very similar manner. 
- All our brains are pretty much wired the same
- Memory is for the most part static


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
