# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
#**Nuclear Nonproliferation**

What do you know about?
#**The history of nuclear weapons and testing**

What decisions do you face?
#**I'll likely move after Lambda School. Do I want to live in a potential nuclear target (city)? Do I want to live in a nation where my tax dollars are supporting the maintenance of nuclear weapons?**

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
#**Where should I live so that I am unlikely to be effected by a nuclear disaster?**

2. Trend related to the news
#**Do geopolitical headliners correlate to the incidence of nuclear accidents / near misses?**

3. Who does that?
#**Which nations lie the most about their nuclear stockpiles? Which nations most closely adhere to treaties?**

4. Answering a question people care about
#**Has past nuclear testing had public health effects?**

5. Valuable to businesses
#**What would the economic and financial effects of a limited "Nuclear Autumn" scenario be?**

6. What's the most popular?
#**Since North Korea began nuclear testing, has immigration in nearby nations changed?**

7. Cost/Money rankings
#**What is the cost to us of having, using, maintaining, and testing nuclear arsenals?**

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
#**The cold war has ended and nuclear risks are a thing of the past.**

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
#**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCF7vPanrY)**

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
#**Real estate values of effected areas were considered when detonating nuclear tests, and are stronly correlated.**

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
#**Under what circumstances do allie nations allow fellow allies to test nuclear weapons within their borders? (For example, the US allowed the UK to test hundreds of nuclear weapons in the Southwest.)**

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
#**Here's an idea... an incidence over time map, like the one above, for songwriters that have gone viral. The circles would be centered in the locality of the viral artist, and its size would be based on the size and fade of their virality.**

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
#**The econometrics of well-being**

What do you know about?
#**The advent of agriculture was disastrous for human well-being.**

What decisions do you face?
#**How can I engineer my lifestyle to improve my well-being?**

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
#**Where do people report the highest levels of subjective well-being?**

2. Trend related to the news
#**What factors that contribute to subjective well being can be employed to reduce suicides?**

3. Who does that?
#**Has Bhutan's institution of measuring "Gross National Happiness" improved the subjective well-being of its citizens?**

4. Answering a question people care about
#**Why am I so stressed out?**

5. Valuable to businesses
#**Can a company improve its profits by investing in employee well-being?**

6. What's the most popular?
#**How does screentime effect your happiness?**

7. Cost/Money rankings
#**How is it that poorer nations sometimes report higher subjective well-being than richer counterparts?**

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
#**Money can't buy happiness. It can. But after about $80k per year, it does nothing for our happiness.**

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
(http://happyplanetindex.org/)

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
#**Social psychology research often asserts that an individual cannot improve their own "setpoint", or overall happiness levels over time. They are more or less stable. What about outliers that have experinced significant enduring increases in their setpoint over time? What do they have in common?**

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
#**What about outliers that have experinced significant enduring DECREASES in their setpoint over time? What do they have in common?**

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
#**What nations generate the highest rate of successful startup ventures per capita PER median income? I.E., in the same way that the HPI measures nations that generate the most happiness with the least resource use... one could devise an index that measures which nations have the highest entrpreneurial success rates with the lowest incomes. WHO IS DOING MORE WITH LESS?**
