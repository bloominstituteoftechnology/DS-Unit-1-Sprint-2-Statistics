        "\n",
        "A confidence interval refers to a neighborhood around some point estimate, the size of which is determined by the desired p-value. For instance, we might say that 52% of Americans prefer tacos to burritos, with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 5%.\n",
        "\n",
        "52% (0.52) is the point estimate, and +/- 5% (the interval $[0.47, 0.57]$) is the confidence interval. \"95% confidence\" means a p-value $\\leq 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the confidence interval includes $0.5$ - which is the natural null hypothesis (that half of Americans prefer tacos and half burritos, thus there is no clear favorite). So in this case, we could use the confidence interval to report that we've failed to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "But providing the full analysis with a confidence interval, including a graphical representation of it, can be a helpful and powerful way to tell your story. Done well, it is also more intuitive to a layperson than simply saying \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\" - it shows that in fact the data does *not* give a single clear result (the point estimate) but a whole range of possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "How is a confidence interval built, and how should it be interpreted? It does *not* mean that 95% of the data lies in that interval - instead, the frequentist interpretation is \"if we were to repeat this experiment 100 times, we would expect the average result to lie in this interval ~95 times.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "For a 95% confidence interval and a normal(-ish) distribution, you can simply remember that +/-2 standard deviations contains 95% of the probability mass, and so the 95% confidence interval based on a given sample is centered at the mean (point estimate) and has a range of +/- 2 (or technically 1.96) standard deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different distributions/assumptions (90% confidence, 99% confidence) will require different math, but the overall process and interpretation (with a frequentist approach) will be the same.\n",
